Former marine Paul Harris walks UK's coastline for mental health||A former Royal Marine has described spending most of the past three years walking the coastline of the UK in a bid to improve his mental health.||Paul Harris was living in Bournemouth and working in a call centre job he loathed when he began the trek in 2020. ||Covid lockdown restrictions had just been eased and he had endured major upheaval in his personal life. ||Now more than 5,000 miles (8,046km) in and nearing the end, Mr Harris said the experience has changed his life. ||The 39-year-old, who served in Afghanistan during his four-and-a-half years in the marines, said he had been at his happiest when he moved to Thailand after leaving the military. ||He told the BBC he felt like he had "completed life" when he got his dream job as a kindergarten teacher and set up his own school in a country he loved. ||But problems with renewing his visa after seven years living in Thailand meant he had to leave, leading to the break-up of a long-term relationship and an unplanned return to the UK. ||"I was back in Bournemouth, working in a call centre selling insurance and - to be honest with you - hating my life," he said. ||"I'm a man and a marine and we don't talk about feelings enough so at that point in time I had four or five months when I just went into myself. ||"The way I spoke to myself was horrendous. I don't recognise that person. Three or four times I wanted to end my own life - I really was that low."||Mr Harris said a message of support from an old friend proved a turning point. ||"[My friend] said 'bro, you need to write a book and walk the UK' and three weeks later I quit my life as such and set up an Instagram. I had 300 in my bank and left."||Mr Harris, who has dubbed himself the Warrior Walker, said the journey has helped him to "heal old wounds" and opened his eyes to the beauty of the UK's coast and the kindness of strangers. ||He added: "I've slept outside only three weeks because people I've met on paths, hotels, B&Bs, stately homes, manor homes, council houses, young people, old people, married, single, gay, straight, black, white and everyone in between has held my hand and given me a hug.||"It makes me emotional when I talk about this because it's still raw. It's changed my life."||Mr Harris hopes to finish the challenge on Saturday 22 April at Sandbanks and wants to do a "victory lap" in aid of mental health charity Mind. ||Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Hibs 1-0 Hearts: What the manager said||Interim manager Steven Naismith spoke to Sportsound after Hearts lost to rivals Hibs, their sixth straight defeat: ||Disappointing in terms of the result. I didnt think there was too much in it, but I didn't think we did enough to win it, and we didnt carry as much of a threat as I hoped wed have in the final third. ||"They are very direct - we dealt with that very well except for one moment and thats what costs you the draw. Its hard to take. ||"We are a good squad, but I felt there was still what has been happening over the past few months still there - everything was a bit reactionary. Weve got another week to work on the things we want to make better. ||"The European spot hasnt been mentioned, I dont think its that big a deal to be honest.In terms of the squad, there hasnt been much chat about third. ||"If I was in this team today as a forward, Id be frustrated because we never had that end part that you need to win games. You need to get back to winning ways; I dont want to be losing games. I fully expect us to have more attacking threat in the coming weeks and I expect us to pick up points.||Corach Rambler wins Grand National after protesters delay start||Premier League: Haaland double puts Man City three up||Women's FA Cup semi-final: Man Utd pull level against Brighton||Who is the greatest football pundit of all times?||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Whats gone wrong with our housing?||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Can they tell the nice guys from the money chasers?||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Have a thrilling movie night tonight!||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now||Pinstickers' guide to the Grand National||Runners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.||Gadirova takes gold in dramatic all-around final.

Ferrari Carlos Sainz: Ferrari's request for driver's penalty review to be heard||Ferrari's request for a review of the penalty imposed on Carlos Sainz at the end of the Australian Grand Prix will be heard on 18 April.||The Spaniard's five-second penalty for colliding with Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin dropped him from fourth to 12th.||The hearing will first assess whether there is significant, new and relevant evidence that was not considered by the stewards in Melbourne.||Only if that is deemed the case will the incident be reviewed by officials.||If the penalty is reassessed, there could be a number of different outcomes - the penalty could remain unchanged, change to a different penalty or be overturned.||Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur said last week he was concerned that two other incidents at the same restart - the penultimate one in a race defined by incidents and stoppages - did not lead to penalties.||The Frenchman highlighted the crash between the two Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon, which led to the retirement of both cars, and which was deemed a racing incident, as well as Williams driver Logan Sargeant ramming Alpha Tauri's Nyck De Vries, which was not investigated by stewards on the day.||Vasseur and Sainz were both frustrated that stewards decided on the penalty almost instantaneously without hearing from the drivers involved. Alonso himself said he felt the decision was "harsh".||Sainz tipped Alonso into a spin that dropped the two-time champion from third to the back of the field. ||The Aston Martin driver was reinstated in third place for the last restart because he was able to rejoin the race and officials deemed that not enough distance had been covered after that restart to designate a different order.||Vasseur said in a news conference last week: "The process is first they will have a look on the petition to see if they can reopen the case and then we will have a second hearing a bit later about the decision itself. ||"What we can expect is to at least have an open discussions with them and for the good of the sport to avoid to have this kind of decision where you have three cases on the same corner and not the same decision. ||"The biggest frustration was from Carlos - and you heard it on the radio - was to not have the hearings, because the case was very special and in this case it would have made sense because the race was over and it was not affecting the podium."||He pointed out that the Gasly-Ocon incident was reviewed by stewards after the race including taking statements from both drivers.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||Analysis and opinion from the BBC's chief Formula 1 writer.||Get the latest results and headlines sent straight to your phone, find all our Formula 1 coverage details with our Live Guide, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.||https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/65279787

Periods: Menstrual cycle shame 'hurts mental health'||Shame about periods can have a detrimental impact on women's mental health, campaigners have said.||A woman whose menstrual symptoms were confused with depression has devised her own social prescribing course.||Meanwhile, two sisters behind the Love Your Period campaign said work was needed to eliminate the taboos surrounding periods for young women.||Molly Fenton said embarrassment linked to girls' periods could affect them "emotionally, physically and mentally". ||"You can teach someone the science and biology, but no-one tells you that sometimes period pain is really bad, or that excessive cramps aren't normal," she added.||"It's often something we might wish our parents had told us - but it's not spoken about in all families either."||The 20-year-old from Cardiff started Love Your Period while she was still in school, earning herself a St David Award in 2021 and a place on the Welsh government's period stigma roundtable.||She and her 16-year-old sister Tilly have since set up "big sister talks" with primary school children.||"We wanted to normalise conversations around periods and make them feel more comfortable, especially when they're younger," said Tilly.||Tilly said they have had some resistance to their work.||"We were in town campaigning back in 2019 and a lot of people were verbally attacking us. They didn't like the fact we were talking about periods," she said. ||"I think people's attitudes are changing and I'm glad that's happening - that's the whole point of what we were doing in the first place, so people can finally talk about it."||"I remember being shown in school three times how to put a condom on, but never told how to use a tampon, or about female contraception," said Molly.||"If some of us have to go past the comfortable stage and shout about it to raise awareness and make it normal, then that's what we'll do."||They hope their work will lead to a better understanding of conditions such as endometriosis and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.||Kate Shepherd Cohen said she was on the brink of taking anti-depressants until she realised her feelings were linked with her menstrual cycle.||Learning to understand it meant she no longer added "layers of suffering" to her physical pain.||She said she was embarrassed to only make the link at the age of 35, which led to "a burning sense of injustice" that other women were also unaware.||Ms Cohen also said that alternatives to anti-depressants were not suggested.||Originally from New Inn, Torfaen, but now living with her family in Cornwall, she has devised a course available on social prescription - a way of connecting people to community support or other non-clinical services.||Since charting the days of her cycle - with day one as the first day of her period - she has learned to identify patterns and how they affect everything from work to relationships.||"Today is my day seven," she said.||"Now I realise that, actually day seven is a day that I feel pretty empowered because I'm just coming back into myself after my menstrual phase.||"It always has the same qualities and that's been a huge surprise to me. Because then not only does day seven have its own qualities but day 12 does, day 18 does, day 28 does. And I found myself understanding and coping so much better."||She said it had also shifted the way she views her periods and helped her understand "the difference between pain and suffering". ||"The pain is not always possible to take away," Kate added.||"But I was adding many layers of suffering to the physical sensation. 'Oh, I'm not a very good mother at this time, I can't do the things I want to do'.||"I've changed my diary around it and I'm able to not be too hard on myself."||As well as reducing the stigma of talking about the menstrual cycle, she said the course aimed to better equip women with evidence if they need to seek medical advice - reducing wasted GP appointments and waiting lists.||She said: "I know from my experience the impact it was having on my family life and my working life.||"I really wanted a pill to take away the pain that I was experiencing around my cycle. There were days where I didn't want to wake up.||"I felt like there was nowhere to turn, I couldn't face the world and I think in those moments I really wanted to just do anything to take that away."||A Welsh government spokesperson said: "Menstrual well-being and learning about the menstrual cycle is mandatory within the new Curriculum for Wales. This includes learning about where to get further information and support. ||"It is important that learning about menstrual well-being is not simply a 'one-off lesson', which is why the Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) Code sets out that it should be taught over time as children grow.||"We have invested a further 500,000 in professional learning to support staff with the new curriculum's requirements, including specific support for schools to deliver RSE."||Poor period provision for women's sport criticised||The men behind a record-breaking period campaign||'Why is menstruation still a taboo subject?'||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

'The key to our success' - Postecoglou urges Celtic focus on Killie||Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou says the key to our success is refusing to look too far ahead as his sides treble chase hits the home stretch.||After last weekends Old Firm triumph, Celtic need a maximum of three wins from their remaining seven games to secure a second successive title.||A Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers is looming at the end of the month, with the Viaplay Cup already in the Parkhead trophy cabinet, but Postecoglous sole focus is on Sundays trip to Kilmarnock.||Looking beyond that has no purpose, he said. Whether thats because we see the finish line close or because theres another competition, it all becomes irrelevant because we know if were not totally focused this weekend we wont be able to get the job done.||Thats been the key to our success so far and why weve been consistent for so long. Everyone has embraced the fact our greatest challenge is the one thats next and that is Sunday.||"Kilmarnock away will be a very tough game because theyve got really strong home form and are fighting against relegation, so its three points well have to earn.||Postecoglou is confident his team will suffer no after-effects from the emotionally and physically draining win over Rangers.||We had a bit of a longer week, playing Saturday to Sunday which means our week is structured a little bit differently, he added.||But I read what is happening by watching the players behaviour and the way were training and theres and no signs there of any aftermath or anything remaining from the game.||"Once we did our review the day we were back in, it was done and dusted and the players were looking forward to the next one.

County Championship: David Bedingham hits ton as Durham dominate Worcestershire||David Bedingham pressed his international credentials with a brilliant century on day one of Durham's County Championship Division Two clash against Worcestershire.||Bedingham declared his intention before the start of this season to play for his home nation South Africa rather than await his availability for an England call. ||He duly delivered a timely reminder of his quality with a sublime innings of 118 after Alex Lees provided the platform with 70 at the top of the order, allowing Durham to post 363-7. ||Ben Gibbon and Adam Finch were the pick of the Worcestershire bowlers, preventing the hosts from building a dominant position by taking timely wickets. ||Gibbon ended the day with 4-75, including the scalp of Bedingham in the final hour.||After being inserted, Durham opener Lees survived two inside edges before settle into a rhythm with Michael Jones.||Back-to-back maidens forced a mistake from Jones to hand Finch the breakthrough. But Adam Finch continued to run in from the Lumley End and his effort ball ended a difficult 58-ball stay for Durham captain Scott Borthwick, who looked rusty following his return from a finger injury. ||England opener Lees was not at his fluent best but displayed much-needed resilience before Gibbon found the gap between bat and pad and removed his middle stump. ||Bedingham then ensured that Durham capitalised on their position of strength, surging to his fifty at almost a run-a-ball. ||The South African was in pristine touch and pressed on toward three figures after taking 15 runs from Finch's 14th over, including a brilliant pull into the pavilion to register his first six of the day. ||Bedingham notched his 14th first-class century with a gentle nudge into the leg side but, after a brief rain break, Gibbon returned with the new ball to prise out Bedingham, ending a fifth-wicket stand of 113 with Graham Clark.||That then became three wickets in seven deliveries when Gibbon and Joe Leach remove Jonathan Bushnell and Clark before Ben Raine and Paul Coughlin stemmed the tide with an unbroken 55-run stand.||Match report supplied by the ECB Reporters' Network.||These comments are now closed.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

Phoenix Rise: Coventry teens' authentic voices' help success of BBC drama||Teenagers added their "authentic voices" to contribute to the success of a BBC drama set at a city high school, a show insider has said.||Set in Coventry, Phoenix Rise tells the story of students returning to learning after exclusion.||Pupils from Finham Park 2 in the city helped in the production with some acting as paid extras. ||The drama has been commissioned for a third and fourth series, the BBC has announced. ||Jo Kerr, a librarian and community champion who co-ordinated the collaboration, said the extras work had helped some children pay bills and feed their families. ||"Some of the pupils come from households where there isn't necessarily a regular income, and so they were able to put food on the table for the first time," she said. ||"One pupil told me she had been to Tesco and was able to buy a donut for the first time ever, and that just made me really sad but happy at the same time."||The school, which also helped with research for the scriptwriters and production crew will be involved in the next two series, she explained. ||Pupils had taken part during some school hours, with others working through the summer holidays. ||"The experience completely changed their mindset about how they view the world of work," said Ms Kerr.||At the end of the first series production in 2022 a quantity of clothes and goods was also donated to the school, "meaning our drama costume department is amazing now," she said.  ||Donations had also been passed to other schools, local charities and families in need. ||A red carpet premier of the first series had also been held at the school. ||"Year 10 students who do food and nutrition spent two days preparing the canapes for that and the head of history and the head of languages ran the bar."||"Having the BBC come to Tile Hill and offering these opportunities to local children has been brilliant," she said.||"What's made the show so successful is that it's authentic voices of Coventry," she added. ||The second series will be available to view on BBC iPlayer later this year.||Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Scottish skatepark considered for listed status||A West Lothian skatepark is in line to become the first to be granted listed status in Scotland. ||Livingston - or "Livi" - skatepark was built in 1981 and has attracted world-famous skaters such as Steve Caballero and Mike McGill.  ||And Tony Hawk drew huge crowds when he skated Livingston's bowl in 1990.||Historic Environment Scotland (HES) is considering giving it listed status, meaning it is an architecturally and historically important site. ||The skatepark was designed and built by architect Ian Urquhart after he was inspired by his wife and dedicated skater Dee Urquhart.||The pair travelled across the United States to learn how to construct and assemble a skatepark.||Since then, the park has become iconic among the skating community.||Local skater Alan Mcintosh recently returned to skateboarding at Livingston after 30 years, aged 48.||"Since I was around 12 or 13, Livi was the place, the mecca, the Scottish Dogtown or Santa Monica," he said.||"At 48 it's still the place I associate with the heart of skateboarding in Scotland.||"Livi plays a critical cultural anchor point to skateboarding in Scotland (and beyond) in the same vein as the Glasgow School of Art or Glasgow University does to its disciplines.||"It should be protected at all costs."||West Lothian Council first applied to secure historic status for the site in 2022. If successful, the skatepark's cultural importance would need to be taken into consideration when making management decisions.||Listing the site would not prevent it being used as a skatepark, but it would ensure the long-term protection and maintenance of the facility.||HES is seeking input from people who know and use the skatepark, or have a view on its design, history and significance.||Skateboard Scotland, the official governing body for skateboarding in Scotland, helped HES shape the survey.||Rick Curran from Skateboard Scotland said: "Livingston (Livi) skatepark is a world renowned and iconic Scottish skatepark recognised by many for its ground-breaking design, built at a time when skateboarding was experiencing a global slump. ||"This design has not only resulted in continuous use by generations of local skaters but has also seen many world-famous pro skaters visit over the years, such as Tony Hawk and Steve Caballero, who recognised Livi's deserved place in skate history.||"Skateboard Scotland are extremely keen for Livingston to retain the essence that makes it a famously strong foundation for Scottish skateboarding, but also to explore necessary steps to ensure this essence is protected for future generations through sympathetic, considered stabilisation and restoration. ||"We look forward to working with the skate community and HES on this."||Currently the only listed skatepark in the UK is Rom skatepark in London.||West Lothian councillor Tom Conn said: "Livingston skatepark is a well-used and much-loved facility by the skating community in West Lothian and further afield.||"We are aware that different users of the park have wide-ranging views on its future and we would encourage as many people as possible to please take part in this questionnaire." ||Dara Parsons, head of designations at HES, said: "We know that Livingston skatepark is a hugely popular piece of urban heritage, renowned among skaters across Scotland and beyond. ||"We want to hear views from as many voices as possible to help us understand more about its cultural and historical significance and its position among our 20th Century heritage."||BBC Scotland - The kids saving an 80s skatepark with some help from Tony Hawk||Housing crisis: Tenants in Edinburgh forking out nearly half of salary on rent||New Tree Time initiative launches encouraging people to sponsor a tree||Sam Heughan: AI creates the perfectJames Bond  and it resembles Outlanders JamieFraser actor Sam Heughan||Plans for UK's largest offshore windfarm off East Lothian coast outlined to group||10 major stores to close for good in further blow for UK high street||New home for Titanic artefacts in Glenrothes||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Mifepristone: Supreme Court keeps abortion pill available for now||The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted a ruling that set limits on access to the abortion pill mifepristone. ||The pause ordered by Justice Samuel Alito is the latest move in an ongoing legal battle over access to the drug.||Last week, a Texas court had ordered the drug to be pulled off the market.||A lower appeals court responded to the Texas ruling by keeping the drug available, but with conditions.||But on Friday, Justice Alito, a conservative, halted the restrictions until right before midnight on 19 April, after the Biden administration filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to restore access to the drug.||The delay will give justices more time to review the case. Justice Alito asked that additional briefing material be filed by 18 April. ||Mifepristone is used in more than half of all US abortions. Experts say the legal fight about its safety will have far-reaching implications for both abortion access and drug regulation in the United States.||The abortion pill was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) more than 20 years ago. It is part of a two-drug regimen that induces abortions - it effectively stops the pregnancy, while the second drug, misoprostol, empties the uterus.||In reaction to the Supreme Court's decision, the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that "the president and his administration continue to stand by FDA's evidence-based approval of mifepristone".||"The stakes of this fight could not be higher in the face of ongoing attacks on women's health," she said."||On 7 April, Texas court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled the FDA had violated federal rules that allowed for the accelerated approval of some drugs, and had erred in its scientific assessment of the abortion pill.||A federal appeals court in New Orleans on Wednesday put a hold on the Texas ruling, but imposed additional limits on the drug that include requiring it to be taken in the presence of a physician. ||This video can not be played||Watch: Abortion pills explained in 60 seconds||Other restrictions included barring patients from receiving the pill by post, and shortening the window for mifepristone's approved use from up to 10 weeks of pregnancy to seven. Those rules were set to take effect on Saturday. ||In response, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) asked the country's top court to strike down the limitations, writing in its appeal that the Texas ruling would lead to "regulatory chaos" for the approval of drugs.||A lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group that filed the initial lawsuit against the FDA, said the Supreme Court's decision on Friday was "standard operating procedure" to give justices time to review the arguments before them. ||"We look forward to explaining why the FDA has not met its heavy burden to pause the parts of the district court's decision that restore the critical safeguards for women and girls," lawyer Erin Hawley said in a statement.||Danco Laboratories, the drug's manufacturer, had also asked the Supreme Court to step in. ||"The lack of emergency relief from this Court will also harm women, the healthcare system, the pharmaceutical industry, states' sovereignty interests, and the separation-of-powers," said Danco attorney Jessica Ellsworth. ||US takes abortion pill case to Supreme Court||How safe is the abortion pill mifepristone?||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

M&S removes T-shirt after being accused of 'ripping off' pub name||Marks and Spencer has removed a T-shirt from sale after a London pub chain accused it of "ripping off" its trademark name.||The T-shirt had the "Craft Beer Co." name in a graphic on the front and back.||M&S said it took "intellectual property very seriously" and added that its design was "in good faith".||The pub chain had tweeted the retailer on Thursday, writing: "What's the idea with these T-shirts!?"||It went on: "Can we expect a royalties cheque in the post!?||"Surely one Iconic British Institution shouldn't be ripping off another.!!"||In a further tweet the company said: "It really is hard to believe in 2023 such things can be signed off by someone at huge PLC."||After being approached for comment, M&S said it had taken the decision to remove the product from sale "so we can investigate further".||In a description of the T-shirt on its website, M&S had said "the St Michael Brewery-themed graphics on the back and chest add a distinctive theme". ||The Craft Beer Co. was set up in Clerkenwell in 2011 by friends Martin Hayes and Peter Slezak, and now operates seven pubs in London and one in Brighton. ||Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hayes said they were alerted to the T-shirt when a punter mentioned it to one of their bar staff on Wednesday.||"I'm not angry about it, but it is a little annoying," he said.||"I've got a lot of respect for M&S. It's an iconic British business and I think somebody's just made a bit of a boo boo really, but I'm sure it will be sorted out," he added.||Mr Hayes said his company was not planning to take any legal action. ||"We're a relatively small business so I don't think we'll be taking on a PLC. This isn't Aldi versus Marks and Spencer," he said.||In 2021, M&S took legal action against supermarket rival Aldi arguing that the latter's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake infringed its Colin the Caterpillar trademark.||Marks and Spencer claimed at the time that Aldi's cake "rides on the coat-tails" of its reputation, and lodged an intellectual property claim at the High Court.||The two companies reached a settlement in the case last year. ||On Thursday night, Aldi tweeted in response to this story: "OH HOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED."||Allow Twitter content?||This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to read Twitters cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose accept and continue.||Mr Hayes said he was pretty sure M&S would withdraw the T-shirt in any case, calling some of the language used in the graphic sexist.||One of the lines reads: "Proper good beer... for proper good blokes", which received an angry response on Twitter.||"So only 'proper blokes' can enjoy beer? It's 2023!" said one. ||"It's really awful wording, very sexist," said Mr Hayes. "It's hard to believe anything like that could be put on a T-shirt these days.||"Our pubs are very inclusive. We've always championed beer, and it's for everybody.||"I can see online that a lot of people are upset about it, and I feel bad about that. I think it reflects really badly on M&S." ||Mr Hayes said one of their pubs was located very near to the M&S headquarters in Paddington in central London and said a team from the company had a booking for this evening. ||"I'm not sure if they'll come now, but if they do come, they can rest assured they'll be treated as well as always," he said.||Colin the Caterpillar cake row crumbles||M&S to create 3,400 jobs as it opens new shops||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

RCN nurses to strike on May bank holiday in England as pay offer rejected||Nurses in the Royal College of Nursing union have rejected the government's pay offer in England and will now go on strike over the first May bank holiday. ||The 48-hour walkout from 20:00 BST on 30 April to 20:00 on 2 May will involve NHS nurses in emergency departments, intensive care, cancer and other wards.||This will be "hugely concerning" for patients, the government says.||Members of the Unison union - which includes some nurses and ambulance crews - have accepted the pay offer. ||The award on the table is a 5% pay rise for 2023-24.||And there is an extra one-off lump sum of at least 1,655 to top up the past year's salary.  ||Meanwhile, NHS junior doctors in England staged a four-day walkout over pay, which ended at 07:00 on Saturday. ||For the first time, the RCN says this new strike will mean some critical care services, such as intensive care, will not be staffed on strike days - something which did not happen in previous walkouts.||The government has said this amounts to an escalation in strike action, "based on a vote from the minority of the nursing workforce".||Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the government had come a long way with its current offer, and urged NHS unions that are still voting to accept the deal because it would be "best for patients and best for staff".||Healthcare bosses say further strikes will have an impact on reducing already lengthy waiting lists for treatment, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to reduce.||The result of the RCN vote on pay was close - 54% voted to reject the offer, while 46% voted to accept it.||The Unison vote, however, was overwhelmingly in favour of the deal.||Pat Cullen, RCN general secretary and chief executive, said the government "needs to increase what has already been offered and we will be highly critical of any move to reduce it". ||She said that until there was a significantly improved offer, RCN nurses would be forced to go back to the picket line.||Sara Gorton from Unison, whose members voted for the pay offer, said: "Clearly health workers would have wanted more, but this was the best that could be achieved through negotiation.||"Over the past few weeks, health workers have weighed up what's on offer. They've opted for the certainty of getting the extra cash in their pockets soon."||A government spokesperson said the Unison decision "demonstrates that it is a fair and reasonable proposal that can bring this dispute to an end".||But it said it was "hugely disappointing" that the RCN had rejected the pay deal recommended by their leadership.||Krupesh Hirani, Labour's health spokesperson at the London Assembly, said the RCN result showed "the strength of feeling among the nursing profession that working conditions in the NHS have deteriorated to unacceptable levels". ||Hundreds of thousands of NHS staff from other unions are still voting on the same pay deal over the next two weeks.||A Downing Street source indicated the government wanted to wait to see the outcome of the other ballots and that it was important to have a full picture before putting forward further steps.||Meanwhile, the RCN told the BBC its members were not looking to strike on the same days as junior doctors. A source from the British Medical Association, the union representing the junior doctors, also said there were no plans for joint action.||Harry Eccles, a clinical nurse specialist on the south coast of England, voted against the government's offer and said he was glad that other nurses did too.||"They're using their voice to fight for our patients and patient safety and fight for the NHS," he said.||But Harry said the one-off sum offered by the government for 2022-23 was "going to pay off a few bills, and then we're going to be in the same predicament".||And he was not impressed by the 5% pay increase for this year either, which he points out is still way below inflation.||Strike action is a last resort, he added.||"The government is refusing to listen, to give us the respect and the time, and to even recognise that without staff there is no NHS."||Nurses began strikes in December in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the largest action of its kind in NHS history.||Health unions in Wales and Northern Ireland are still in negotiations with their governments over pay, as healthcare and its budgets are devolved to all four nations of the UK.||There has been no industrial action by nurses in Scotland after they accepted a pay offer from the Scottish government that will mean a 6.5% increase from this month, on top of a 7.5% rise for 2022-23.||The government announced a pay offer for nurses in England on 16 March.||Other strikes involving school teachers, railway workers and passport office workers have also taken place across the UK in recent months.||The RCN says it will now reballot its members in England to see if they want to continue taking industrial action after the strike in early May.||Unite and the GMB will announce the result of their ballots on the same pay deal in two weeks' time.||Are you a nurse with a view on the strike?

Guernsey FC can target promotion if squad stays fit, says defender Tom Vaudin||Guernsey FC defender Tom Vaudin says the club are capable of challenging for promotion next season if they can keep their squad fit. ||The Green Lions were bottom of Isthmian League South Central with just 11 points in early January.||But a run of eight wins and five draws in 17 games has seen Guernsey seal survival with three games left.||It is form, which if repeated through the while season, would put Guernsey in the play-off places. ||"You've got to be looking at that promotion push again," Vaudin told BBC Radio Guernsey when asked about ambitions for next season. ||"It's hard to say because we're on an island with a limited amount of people and limited players, so a few injuries and it can really have a massive effect on the team.||"These UK teams can go and just buy a few extra players in and they're all right, so it does put us in a much more difficult position.||"However, I think if everyone does stay fit and healthy, with the calibre of player that we've got, we can definitely push for promotion next season."||While Vaudin has featured in 33 of Guernsey's 35 league games this season, manager Tony Vance has had selection headaches.||Influential players such as Kieran Mahon, Charlton Gauvain, Will Fazakerley and Ross Allen have all missed significant chunks of the season, especially before Christmas. ||"I think people were thinking this could be us heading towards relegation by the end of the season," added Vaudin.||"But we've pulled together and with three games left, to be safe is absolutely amazing. ||"I was told a stat that the second half of the season, if we could have replicated it in the first half we would actually be third in the table, so it just shows the comeback that we've made."|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now||https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65274516

The roof was on fire and it was quickly spreading across the building."||Recalling the previous tragedy, she added: "This is a tight knit community which always stands by each other in hard times.

Westcliff woman fears losing independence when guide dog retires||A campaigner for blind people will be without a guide dog for the first time in 51 years when hers retires in June.||Jill Allen-King, 83, from Westcliff, Essex, fears she may have to wait 18 months to be given another dog due to a national shortage.||She said her current guide dog, Jagger, who will be 11 in August, was "fit and well" and still wanted to work.||The Guide Dogs charity said there had been a shortage of dogs due to the restrictions of the pandemic.||The lockdown in 2020 led to a pause on breeding and made puppy training difficult due to the closure of restaurants and other public spaces.||Ms Allen-King had to have one of her eyes removed as a baby due to measles and lost her sight fully aged 24, on her wedding day, due to glaucoma. ||Since then she has campaigned for better access rights for blind and partially sighted people.||She came up with the idea for textured pavements at road crossings and was given an OBE for her services to disabled people.||Ms Allen-King, who has had seven guide dogs in the past 51 years, said she was worried about losing her independence.||In March she met with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and asked him to help with the shortage of guide dogs across the UK.||Her MP, Southend's Anna Firth, asked the Guide Dogs charity to make an exception and allow Jagger to continue working rather than leave her without a dog.||Jagger was assessed by the charity and on Wednesday, its chief operations officer, Peter Osborne, told Mrs Allen-King the dog would "very likely" be retired in June.||Ms Firth said she was "disappointed" by the decision and would be seeking assistance from the prime minister.||"Having made such enormous progress as a society to give blind people back their independence, we must not allow blind and partially sighted people to become the hidden victims of Covid," she said.||"Jagger has been looking after Jill for many years and is literally her connection with the outside world.||"Waiting for anywhere between 15 months and 3 years for a replacement dog is just not acceptable for an octogenarian Pride of Britain lifetime achievement winner.  ||"I will not leave a stone unturned to get Jill a replacement guide-dog as soon as possible."||Mr Osborne said: "We completely understand how difficult it is for Ms Allen-King and for other guide dog owners when their dog retires or when they are waiting for a new guide dog. ||"We must carefully consider the health, wellbeing and welfare of the dog as well as their owner when it comes to making the difficult decision about retiring a guide dog."||Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Sport in Wales: Clubs pay hundreds as weather hits grassroot clubs||Grassroots teams in Wales say they are struggling to play the sport they love as heavy rain floods their pitches.||Caerphilly AFC have faced multiple problems, largely due to poor weather, and said the situation is costing them hundreds of pounds.||And Porthcawl RFC U15's have had to cancel some home games since January.||It comes after Wales experienced the fifth wettest March since records began in 1836, leaving many grounds and pitches unplayable. ||Most clubs are responsible for their own maintenance, but do receive some support from bodies such as local councils and Sport Wales.||Sport Wales said they do offer support in times of extreme weather.||Wales recorded the wettest spring this year and Caerphilly AFC are just one team having issues due to their pitch being waterlogged. ||They said they have to pay "hundreds of pounds in order to ensure games get played", having to rent generators, other pitches and mini buses.||Club members have also spent a lot hours clearing water and laying sand to make the fields playable.||This season, just four games have been played at home, which team manager Ian Butterworth said puts them at a "disadvantage".||Most of their games are played on 3G pitches nearby, which are better equipped for most weather, but come at a cost of about 200 per game, which the club funds through sponsorship and player contribution.||Ian, who is also part of the committee, said: "Caerphilly has such like a large catchment area, and it hasn't got a facility in the area that we can use.||"It's just nuts."||He added the situation further separates clubs like his from those with more money and better facilities.||"Clubs who play in a higher league get priority access for the 3G facilities even if they're from outside the area," he said.||"We're not funded by anybody. We haven't got a millionaire owner. So it's just we rely on the boys and local sponsorship."||Ian is speaking to the council about taking over a local park in order to put work in that would prevent this happening in the future.||But he said: "We are just up against it now, and the league's asking us questions about the pitch as it's never available. Should we be playing in this league?"||People like Ian are often volunteers and he said they put so much effort into it because they love the game and players are not paid.||So the club and their supporters have the extra stress of worrying about things such a petrol money to get to the playable sites.||It means they are constantly worried about the weather, he said.||This weekend they have provisionally booked a pitch in Cardiff, costing them 200.||"So the boys have to fund their own petrol money we try and lift share, but you know it's tough sometimes with people working," he added.||"Sometimes think you know what is the point?||"I put a lot of effort into it, and you know all voluntary, and I love it."||He said he feels like it is "going the right way" but said the challenges will continue until an alternative is found.||Jon Staples, a coach at Porthcawl RFC U15's, said communities need to come together to make sure facilities are usable.||"You just can't get on to a pitch, not only to play games, but even to train," he said.||"The pitches are so water damaged that if we were to train on them, it would just damage the pitch and we won't be able to use it at all in the future."||He said the solution is to "pump money" into grassroots sports and change pitches to 4G so that they can be used by the whole community all year round.||The other solution, he said, is to change the season with matches in the spring and summer rather than winter to stop people "losing out".||The Welsh government said "investing in grassroots facilities is a key commitment". ||"We have allocated a budget of 8m a year - 24m over three years - to drive forward improvements that are key to increasing participation across all sports," it added. ||"A number of pitches in Wales are in the control of local authorities, and they have a responsibility for their upkeep."||So far this Spring, it's been pretty mixed...||We've had our fifth wettest March on record, and records go back to 1836||The Met Office weather stations recorded over 200mm of rain, that's double our long-term average||Looking at climate change projections we expect milder and wetter winters||With more intense rainfall, this will mean outdoor sports pitches have a greater risk of flooding||Meanwhile, we expect hotter, drier summers and this will mean more people are at risk of heat stroke and heat exhaustion whilst participating in sports.||Owen Hathway, Sport Wales' director of insight, policy and public affairs, said: "We want to see as many people taking part in sport as possible and, obviously, poor pitch conditions, especially in periods of significant bad weather, can be disruptive to this.||"Support is available though for community clubs and organisations who are struggling with pitch conditions."||He added the Be Active Wales Fund offers money to improve pitch quality for issues such as drainage and other upgrades.||Mr Hathway said the organisation work in collaboration with the FAW, Hockey Wales and the WRU, providing capital funding for the development of 3G pitches across Wales which helps to reduce the strain being put on grass pitches.||Changes agreed for Welsh grassroots football||Further funding for grassroots football projects||Wrexham fans welcome 'neighbour' Ryan Reynolds||Poor period provision for women's sport criticised||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Edenfield Centre: Health boss resigns after abuse investigation||The boss of an NHS mental health trust is stepping down six months after a BBC investigation found a "toxic culture of abuse" on one of its secure units. ||Panorama uncovered a "culture of humiliation, verbal abuse and bullying" at the Edenfield Centre in Prestwich near Manchester in September last year.||Neil Thwaite has been the chief executive at Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust since 2018. ||He said it was "time to hand over the reins" as improvements were under way. ||The BBC investigation unearthed extensive evidence of patient maltreatment at the medium secure unit and a number of staff members were sacked or suspended following the programme.||It also triggered a review by the Good Governance Institute (GGI), which found the trust put those in its care and staff at "undue risk".||Mr Thwaite will continue in his role for the next few months to serve his full notice while recruitment for his replacement gets under way.||"Following the awful failings highlighted at Edenfield and other challenges, the last six months have been incredibly difficult for everyone," he said.||"Through engaging with staff, service users, carers and stakeholders, we have worked on our plan to get the organisation on the right path for recovery. ||"Now we have launched our improvement plan, which will be implemented over the next two years, I feel this is the right time to hand over the reins to a new [chief executive]. ||"The plan strengthens our approach to ensure the safety of our service users and staff, ensuring high quality care."||Bill McCarthy, chairman of the trust, said he wished him well for the future, describing him as a "compassionate, visible leader".||Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Man 'eaten alive' by bed bugs in Atlanta jail - family||A man who died in an Atlanta jail cell was "eaten alive by insects and bed bugs", the family's lawyer has alleged. ||Lashawn Thompson was jailed on a misdemeanour and placed in the Fulton County Jail psychiatric wing after officials judged him mentally ill.||Family attorney Michael D Harper released photos showing Mr Thompson's body riddled with bugs.||He is calling for a criminal investigation and told reporters a lawsuit is pending.||"Mr Thompson was found dead in a filthy jail cell after being eaten alive by insects and bed bugs," Mr Harper said in a statement. "The jail cell Mr Thompson was housed in was not fit for a diseased animal. He did not deserve this."||According to a Fulton County Medical Examiner's report, Mr Thompson was found unresponsive in his jail cell on 19 September - three months after his arrest - and pronounced dead following attempts by local police and medical personnel to resuscitate him, according to USA Today.||Mr Harper says jail records show detention officers and medical staff noticed Mr Thompson was deteriorating but did nothing to administer aid or otherwise help him, the BBC's US media partner CBS News reported.||The medical examiner's report said there was a "severe bed bug infestation" in his cell in the psychiatric ward but said there were no clear signs of trauma on Mr Thompson's body. ||The report listed the cause of death as undetermined.||Photos released by the lawyer paint a morbid picture of Mr Thompson, whose face and torso can be seen covered in bugs. ||Conditions of the jail cell as seen in the images are "horrific", said Michael Potter, an entomologist at the University of Kentucky, who specializes in bed bugs. ||"I've dealt with bed bugs for 20-plus years," Mr Potter told the BBC. "I've never seen anything quite to this level if this is in fact what I'm seeing." ||Bed bug bites are not usually deadly, but in some rare cases, Mr Potter said, prolonged exposure to a massive bed bug infestation can cause severe anaemia, which can be lethal if left untreated.||"Bed bugs feed on blood and very large numbers of bed bugs feed on very large amounts of blood," Mr Potter said. In other extreme cases, Mr Potter said, victims may experience an allergic reaction and go into anaphylactic shock, which can also be deadly. ||"It's no secret that the dilapidated and rapidly eroding conditions of the current facility make it incredibly difficult to meet the goal of providing a clean, well-maintained and healthy environment for all inmates and staff," the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.||The Office, which runs the jail, has announced a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr Thompson's death. In addition, the statement said, it had made an immediate expenditure of $500,000 "to address the infestation of bed bugs, lice, and other vermin within the Fulton County Jail".||The jail has also updated "protocols for security rounds to include addressing sanitary conditions," according to the statement.||"The ongoing investigation is examining details regarding the medical care provided and ultimately will determine whether any criminal charges are warranted in this case," the statement said.||The Sheriff's Office also reiterated a call for building a new, larger jail to "provide an elite level of care, mental health services, security and cleanliness." County commissioners are studying feasibility plans for a new Fulton County Jail to replace current facilities which have a long reputation of being overpopulated, underfunded, and unsanitary.  ||Last year, the Southern Center for Human Rights published a press release titled Uncontained Outbreaks of Lice, Scabies Leave People at Fulton Jail Dangerously Malnourished, in which it outlined the many troubles plaguing the facility and offered recommendations to "contain future outbreaks" and improve "hygiene practices".||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Carmarthen train cleaner, 80, says he still loves his job||An 80-year-old train cleaner who works shifts until the early hours of the morning says he loves his job - and has no plans to retire just yet.||William Gwyn Thomas, who used to be a dairy farmer in Lampeter, Ceredigion, has been cleaning trains at Carmarthen station for 25 years.||Gwyn, as he prefers to be known, works with a team to clean anywhere between 18 and 26 carriages a night.||"I didn't expect I'd still be working at 80," said Gwyn. ||"But I really love it, and I'll finish when I'm ready and when I feel I can't do it as well."||Gwyn - who has three children, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren - joined the train cleaning team in the late 1990s.||He credits his long working life to "eating well, not drinking anything stronger than a shandy and cutting down on smoking".||Working from 19:30 to 02:30, Gwyn and his team clean each carriage from top to bottom, including the cabs, toilets, tables and floors.||The worst shifts tend to be Saturdays, when Transport for Wales (TfW) said the toilets can be "challenging", but Gwyn said he takes it all in his stride.||"It's annoying but there's no point moaning about it because that's the job and we just have to get on with it," he said.||"Someone has to get it looking nice for customers again."||TfW's cleaning manager Wendy Jones, and Carmarthen station manager James Nicholas, described Gwyn as "part of the fabric of Carmarthen".||Wishing him a happy 80th birthday, they added: "The standard of work Gwyn puts in night after night is a true example to us all on how to show pride in your work".||The 80-year-old footballer preparing to retire||Butcher retires at 80 after decades in same town||Mechanic retires after 75 years with same company||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Leicester: Firms' support for music festival in Victoria Park||Plans to stage a major two-day music festival in Leicester have been welcomed by local businesses.||Festival Republic - which organises events like Download and Wireless - have applied for a licence to put on an event at Victoria Park in the city.||Firms hope it will bring them a much-needed financial boost after the coronavirus pandemic.||If approved, the festival will take place on 16 and 17 September with a capacity of 38,000 people per day.||Letters have been sent to local residents and businesses telling them about the planned event.||It said the festival would have two stages  - one where about eight artists would perform each day whilst the other would be used for DJs.||Live music would start at 12:30 BST and finish no later than 22:30 on the Saturday and 22:00 on the Sunday.||The park has previously held concerts by Kasabian as well as Leicester City's title celebrations in 2016.||It also hosted acts like Craig David, Alicia Keys and Busted at Radio 1's One Big Sunday events between 2001 and 2003.||In 2020 Leicester become known for spending more time in lockdown than anywhere else and so firms have said they hope an event like this could repair some of the economic damage.||Gabby Miller, from the online magazine Cool as Leicester, said: "Having something like this, bringing new people into the city, bringing people back into the city, is just a massive thing to have.||"It uplifts everybody, they spend in local businesses, it would be a great thing to happen."||Businesses on nearby Queen's Road, in the fashionable Clarendon Park area of the city, were excited by the plans.||Miteche Trambaclal, the director of Portuguese restaurant Port and Nata, said it was a fantastic idea.||"It's quite amazing because since Covid business has been a bit weak.||"I think this might bring more people," he said.||Lindsey Barretto, the manager of Grounded Kitchen, said: "Times have been tough, we have been quiet.||"For me to be able to experience something and for it to be able to help our business would be absolutely outstanding."||Local people have expressed some concern over noise and litter but have still widely supported the festival plans.||One person said: "I think it's brilliant for the area, brilliant for the neighbourhood and I really welcome it."||Another said: "I think it's a really positive idea. Previously they had stuff like Kasabian on the park and Leicester City and it really lit up the area.||"I think the park is maybe under utilised."||Festival Republic is holding a drop-in event to answer questions from the local community on 19 April.||Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Victoria Market: Traders left 'thousands of pounds out of pocket'||A trader at a Nottingham market has said he is thousands of pounds out of pocket as tenants await a decision on their future. ||Nottingham City Council said itmay end the lease on the Victoria Marketin a bid to save 39m over 50 years.||But a decision has still not been made more than 18 months after the plan was first made public.||The council has previously said it does not expect to make a final decision on the market before the end of April.||It said it had been running the market at a loss since 2014, and had been forced to subsidise it at a cost of more than 1.5m a year.||Nick Clark, of Cobblers and Keys said: "I need to know the cost and if we are staying or going." ||The marketopened in the shopping centre in 1972 and was once home to more than 200 stalls, but now only about 30 traders remain.||Mr Clark said he was initially given a date for the early surrender of his lease on 28 February.||He said a compensation package was offered and he almost secured a new lease in the main Victoria Centre, before being informed the early lease surrender was "no longer being processed".||The trader told the Local Democracy Reporting Service he had already spent 3,500 on a solicitor for the early lease surrender for which the council will reimburse.||But he is having to spend a similar sum in legal costs for the new lease which the council will not pay for.   ||Another 1,500 is also needed for a specialist removal team.||A spokesperson for the Victoria Centre said it had been told the early release could not be progressed at the time being and it was looking to clarify the situation beyond April.||Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

County Championship: Hampshire recover from 39-4 to post 254 against Surrey||Ben Brown's battling 95 held Hampshire together after champions Surrey had threatened to overwhelm them with an impressive five-man pace attack on day one of their County Championship match at the Kia Oval.||Hampshire were struggling at 114-6 just after lunch, after opting to bat, but Brown was joined by Keith Barker in a determined seventh-wicket stand of 96 in 35 overs as they made it to 254 to frustrate Rory Burns' side.||By the close Surrey were 37 without loss in reply with Burns and Dom Sibley looking solid on 23 and 12 not out respectively.||Yet it might have been a day totally dominated by Surrey if Brown, on three, had not survived a difficult chance to Tom Lawes on the deep backward square leg boundary when he aimed a pull at Sean Abbott.||In addition, Hampshire opener Fletcha Middleton, who made 32, was dropped on nought by keeper Jamie Smith off Kemar Roach.||Lawes, brought in to Surrey's side due to Ben Foakes' absence with a minor back complaint - Smith taking the gloves - finished with 4-58, with the rest of Hampshire's wickets shared out between the the other four seamers and last man Mohammad Abbas run out for a duck after being sent back by James Fuller, who made a useful unbeaten 23.||Brown, the former Sussex captain who moved to Hampshire last year, fought for almost four hours while Barker's 58 occupied 130 balls.||Surrey struck two early blows through West Indies Test fast bowler Roach, who had Felix Organ leg-before for eight in the fourth over and then, from around the wicket, bowled Nick Gubbins for two.||A mini-revival ended when James Vince, after three fours in his 18, pushed hard at Abbott and edged to first slip where Sibley held on at the second attempt, falling to his right.||And, in the next over, Hampshire slumped further to 39-4 when Lawes struck with his second ball, a magnificent leg-cutter that hit Liam Dawson's off-stump to send him back for one.||But Middleton and Brown, after his early escape, did well to add 49 with Brown driving Abbott through extra cover and past mid off for fours before taking 10 runs from Jordan Clark's opening over.||At 88, however, Clark produced a beauty to feather the edge of Middleton's defensive bat 15 minutes before lunch and when Ian Holland fell soon afterwards, held in the gully off Dan Worrall for five, it seemed as if Surrey were on course to bowl out Hampshire for a below-par score.||But Brown, completing his half-century from 79 balls, withstood all that Surrey's pace quintet could throw at him while Barker hung on grimly despite looking uncomfortable against the short ball.||Hampshire reached tea at 179-6, but Brown had added only another 13 runs after the interval before Lawes pinned him leg-before with a full-length inswinger. He had faced 167 balls, hitting 11 fours.||Barker was eventually caught down the legside by Smith, who then yorked Kyle Abbott for two before Fuller turned down a second run to long off to leave Abbas stranded.||Match report supplied by the ECB Reporters' Network.||These comments are now closed.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

Craig Breen: Fellow WRC drivers pay emotional tributes after death of Irishman||Craig Breen's fellow competitors in the World Rally Championship have spoken of their devastation after the Irishman's death in a testing accident in Croatia.||The Waterford man's co-driver James Fulton was unharmed in the accident which happened around 11:00 BST on Thursday.||Former world champion Ott Tanak said following the news that "everything is just broken".||"I can't believe I am writing this now," said the Estonian.||"Life can be so fragile and unfair I can't believe we've lost you mate! Just we've been texting and another moment you're not answering anymore, I'll miss you buddy so bad, so so bad."||Breen's Hyundai team-mate Thierry Neuville said that the Irishman's "passion for rallying for immeasurable".||"Today I've lost a team-mate but more than anything, I have lost a friend," said the Belgian.||"Your joy behind the steering wheel was beyond any of ours, your emotional stage-end comments in a league of its own.||"You were the first to bring the English tea to Hyundai Motorsport, you made our debriefs last three hours or more, we had endless conversations about our private rally cars.||"All this will stay deep in my memories. I will miss you. Rest easy my friend."||Eight-time world champion Sebastien Ogier said "everyone loved Craig for his great Irish character and his enthusiasm for our sport".||"My thoughts are with his family and friends in this very sad time. RIP Craig, we will miss you," added the Frenchman.||Ogier's compatriot Sebastien Loeb spoke of a sport that "can be cruel".||"It is the case today for your loved ones and for the family of WRC and motorsport. Rest in peace Craig."||Welsh driver Elfyn Evans said Breen "will be sorely missed" while New Zealand's WRC competitor Hayden Paddon described the Irishman as "a legend of a human being and driver".||Breen's fellow Irishman Kris Meeke said his lasting memory of the Waterford native would be "as the guy who took time with my kids and made them laugh more than I could".||"Life just doesn't care. Sometimes there's no rhyme or reason. Just emptiness," said the Dungannon man.||"Craig, this morning you woke up the happiest man alive.. living your dream.

The Highland roofer aiming high with Banksy-style work||A Highland roofer has been winning fans with his artwork incorporated into the tops of buildings - including one inspired by Banksy. ||Gary McIntyre, from Dingwall, came up with the idea a few years ago, and word has been spreading about his designs.||Girl with Balloon is one of the most famous works by secretive street artist Banksy, and has now inspired Mr McIntyre's work on an Inverness roof.||He incorporates lead and copper into his ornamental roof slate work.||A show panel at the self-employed roofer's house allows him to construct designs over several hours and then install them on location.||He originally had a lead stag idea but it involved a listed building so did not happen, but someone else wanted the design instead.||Mr McIntyre described what has since followed as a "snowball effect" as word-of-mouth spread.||"You walk past so many plain roofs during the day and your eyes never come to them because they're not pretty to look at," he told BBC Scotland.||"But if you start putting things like Banksy's Girl with Balloon, stags and fishermen and salmon and stuff like that, then it's definitely an eye-catcher.||"As soon as you see that red balloon it automatically pulls your eye, you can't help but look at it."||Of that particular design, he explained: "I was only supposed to go into the job and re-slate the back of his [the client's] roof.||"But I approached the client and asked if he would be willing to let me put the girl with the red balloon into his roof for free. Banksy does not charge so I thought I cannot ask for anything.||"He said that was his wife's favourite artist and painting."||Mr McIntyre said first and foremost it was his job to keep water out of people's roofs.||"There can't be mistakes made," he said. "All the regulations have been adhered to.||"The interest I'm getting is unreal, I've not had any negative feedback, it's all been positive, which is good. I feel super proud.||"I totally feel passionate about these works, and hope that I can start putting works of art into people's roofs throughout the UK if possible."||He also insisted that he definitely is not the actual Banksy.||"I wish I was," he laughed. ||"With the kind of revenue that he brings in from these paintings I would love to be, but no, sadly I'm not Banksy."||Banksy works sell for millions at auction||Missing Clackmannanshire man believed to have travelled to Fort William||5 great places to enjoy haggis in Inverness and Ross-shire 5 great places to enjoy haggis in Inverness and Ross-shire||Secret Drinker reviews the Black Isle Bar in Inverness||65-year-old motorcyclist killed following two-vehicle crash on the A835 near Garve||UPDATE: Man (65) killed in crash on A835, police confirm||Major Highland road closed following crash between car and motorbike||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Titanic hero's medals are to go under the hammer||Medals awarded to a telegraphist whose actions helped save 700 passengers on the Titanic are to go under the hammer.||Wireless operator Harold Cottam, 21, was on board the RMS Carpathia on 14 April 1912 when he identified the Titanic's distress signal as it sank.||He alerted his captain, who initiated the rescue of the passengers on the vessel, which had struck an iceberg. ||The medals are being sold alongside photographs, Mr Cottam's pocket watch and signed paperwork. ||According to well documented events of that night, Mr Cottam had finished for the day, but was using the transmitter to take general news from Marconi's wireless station in Cape Cod.||While doing this, he also picked up a batch of messages intended for the Titanic and, having heard the famous ship's own telegraphist had been overworked, he took them down and made contact.||To his astonishment, the operator responded: "Come at once we have struck a berg. Position 41.46 N 50.15 W."||Mr Cottam raced to tell the captain of the RMS Carpathia, which became the only vessel that responded to the distress call. ||The steamship arrived the following morning and 700 people were rescued from the icy waters of the north Atlantic Ocean.||Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: "Though he had already worked an 18-hour day, Cottam stayed at his radio for the next three days until he collapsed from exhaustion.||"When he arrived in America, he was whisked directly to Washington to appear at an official inquiry held by the US senate, after which he was hailed by the press as a hero."||Mr Cottam was awarded a silver Carpathia medal and a Liverpool Humane Society medal for bravery.||Mr Aldridge continued: "Cottam never cashed in on his fame, refusing even to be interviewed about the disaster for most of his life.||"Despite his relative obscurity, a true hero in every sense of the word and this archive represents the vital part he played in the lives of those saved from the Titanic."||The lot is expected to fetch between 20,000 and 30,000 when it goes under the hammer at Henry Aldridge and Son Ltd in Wiltshire on 22 April. ||Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Tottenham 2-3 Bournemouth: What Stellini said||Tottenham interim manager Cristian Stellini, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "It is a really tough day today because we didn't achieve what we want. We gave everything on the pitch and I think everyone understands this. But we allowed them to score the first two goals too easily. Too easy, too easy. It is difficult then when you are one goal down. You have to be strong in this moment to create a unit and have our fans with us. In the second half we tried to push and we were so close to scoring. After the second goal, Richarlison heads the ball to win the game.||"If Richarlison scores that opportunity we are probably here to enjoy a moment. But now we do not enjoy because we allowed them to score three goals.||"I think we play very good in the first half, the first 20 minutes. We scored but then from scoring to conceding their second goal I am not happy with the performance. When you score one, the mindset has to be to score again. We didn't do this. It is important for me that they understand why you try to score one more rather than conceded chances."||Corach Rambler wins Grand National after protesters delay start||Premier League: Haaland double puts Man City three up||Women's FA Cup semi-final: Man Utd pull level against Brighton||Who is the greatest football pundit of all times?||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Whats gone wrong with our housing?||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Can they tell the nice guys from the money chasers?||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Have a thrilling movie night tonight!||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now||Pinstickers' guide to the Grand National||Runners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.||Gadirova takes gold in dramatic all-around final.

Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||And we'll keep you signed in.||Sign in  or  Register||You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. Its the law.||  Edited by Tom Spender||All times stated are UK||James Gregory||Live reporter||As we draw to the end of our live coverage, here's a recap of the day's key events in Sudan:||Mohanad Hashim||BBC Africa||This has been the much-feared worst-case scenario. A powerstruggle between the two most powerful generals in Sudan. ||With fighting going on for 12hours, it is not clear who has the upper hand and the situation beyond Khartoumremains murky and confusing. Throughout the day claims from both campssuggested their forces were on top of the situation, but recent reports suggestthings are very volatile. ||The two generals have a long workingpartnership that dates back to the early 2000s in the bloody, genocidal Darfurconflict. Since 2019, the RSF has thought to present itself as a legitimatenational force instead of a tribal and ethnic militia used incounter-insurgency. The group runs one of the largest mercenary operations inthe world and has been involved in Yemen and Libya. They have good working tieswith the Russian mercenary group Wagner and are reported to have huge businessand mining interests in Sudan.  ||Their adversary, the Sudanese army, hasbeen the dominant political force in Sudan for decades. Recently ties withthe RSF have worsened over security sector reform and how long the RSF needsto merge into the army.||It is now night-time in the capital, Khartoum, and while people are breaking the fast witnesses are saying that the sounds of fighting can still be heard.||One reporter in Omdurman, just on the other side of the Nile to Khartoum, told the BBC that there has been gunfire, but military jets have stopped flying overhead.||Journalist Isma'il Kushkush, who has been tweeting regular updates from the Sudanese capital, has said that heavy artillery fire has resumed in downtown Khartoum.||There is a sense of concern over what might unfold overnight.||Earlier we reported that Saudi Arabian Airlines said one of its jets "had an accident" at Khartoum before its scheduled departure for Riyadh. ||The state-owned airline has now said the plane came under fire while it was on the tarmac.||Passengers, crew and staff were moved from the airport to the Saudi embassy in the capital Khartoum, the airline said.||The airline has suspended flights to and from Sudan until further notice.||International flights appear to be avoiding Sudanese airspace as they cross the continent.||Aviation analyst Alex Macheras has been tracking flights on the FlightRadar24 website and has noticed that they are all avoiding the area.||This means that the journeys will take longer and the planes may need extra fuel.||An Emirates flight from Brazil to the UAE is making an unsceduled stop in Tanzania to refuel "due to the sudden requirement to avoid Sudans airspace", Macheras has tweeted.||FightRadar24 also shows that the Kenayn Airways flight KQ103 from London to Nairobi, which on Friday flew over Sudan, has today taken a different route over the Red Sea and Eritrea.||RSF has shared a video which they claim shows Egyptian troops who had "surrendered" to them at Merowe Airport - some 271 miles (436km) north of Khartoum.||The footage, which has been seen by Reuters but not verified, shows a number of men dressed in combat uniform, crouched on the ground and speaking to members of the RSF in an Egyptian Arabic dialect to troops in RSF uniforms. ||Egyptianand Sudanese troops have periodically staged joint military exercises in the northof the country in the wake of diplomatic tensions with Ethiopia.||An Egyptian military spokesman says the situation in Sudan is being followed closely, adding that the military is currently co-ordinating with the relevant authorities to guarantee the safety of Egyptian forces, Reuters reports.||Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, has released a statement on the unfolding situation in Sudan. ||The statement says the leader of the bloc is urging "political and military parties to find a fair political solution to the crisis that arose after the 25 October 2021 coup and its disastrous consequences".||Mahamat is referring to the day the Sudanese military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, took control of the government in Sudan.||Mr Mahamat's statement appeals to the army and the RSF to:||...immediately stop the destruction of the country, the terrorisation of its population, and the bloodshed during the last 10 days of Ramadan."||Sudan's membership of the African Union was suspended in June 2019.The bloc is made up of 55 states from across the continent.||BBC Nairobi reporter Emmanuel Igunza explains why paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces are in conflict with the government in Sudan. ||Igunza said the RSF are "a power outfit and very feared by many people in Sudan". ||He added that people want the unit to be disbanded and become part of the army.||British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has tweeted in the last few moments. ||He says the violence in Sudan "must stop immediately". ||The UK calls on the Sudanese leadership to do all they can to restrain their troops and deescalate to prevent further bloodshed.||Military action will not resolve this situation."||Heavy gunfire has been heard in parts of Sudan's capital, Khartoum, after clashes started between parliamentary forces and the army. ||People have been filmed running away and taking cover as black smoke continues to rise in the city and the unrest continues. ||A Reuters journalist said they saw armoured vehicles and heard weapons in the streets.||Former Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok has made a statement in a video posted on his Facebook account.||He says the "exchange of fire must stop immediately" and calls on the Sudanese people to "stay strong". ||My first message is to General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, and the leaders of the Sudanese military, and to Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, and the leaders of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The exchange of fire must stop immeditately, and the voice of reason must rule, everyone will lose, and there is no victory when it is atop the bodies of our people."||He asks the Sudanese people not to allow "the drums of war to take over", before issuing a plea to the international community to "do their duty in finding a solution".||Hamdok served from 2019 until he was ousted in the October 2021 coup, before being reinstated again a month later.||He resigned last year after long-running disagreements with the army.||What's happening now is the latest upheaval since the toppling of Sudan's long-serving President Omar al-Bashir.||Bashir - who had been in power for nearly three decades - had been confronted by months of street protests when generals ousted him in April 2019.||The military promised a transition to civilian rule, but the demonstrators vowed to stay on the streets demanding a role in the government.||A joint military-civilian government was then agreed in August 2019, which was supposed to pave the way for elections.||But there were tensions between the sides and two years later the military staged another coup.||Since then, attempts to resurrect the plan to move towards civilian rule have hit problems.||A framework proposal agreed last December has been rejected by both pro-military and civilian groups and has not been finalised.||The central African country of Chad has closed its 872-mile (1,403 km) eastern border with Sudan "until further notice", Reuters news agency reports.||"Chad appeals to the regional and international community as well as to all friendly countries to prioritise a return to peace," the government said in a statement.||As we've been reporting, there have been conflicting accounts throughout the day about who has control of Khartoum's key sites.||General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country's leader and head of the military, has denied claims by the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group that it controlled the presidential palace, military headquarters and airport.||In a recorded phone call with Al Jazeera TV, Gen al-Burhan insisted his forces remained in control.||Emmanuel Igunza||Reporting from Nairobi||Clashes are continuing in and around several locations in the centre of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. ||Witnesses have told the BBC that they have taken shelter in their homes as fighting spreads to residential areas. ||Many roads and bridges in the capital have been sealed off. ||Flights into the city are also turning around and there are reports of a commercial plane being hit by an explosive while on the tarmac in Khartoum. ||The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) says it has taken control of at least three airports, the army chief's residence and the presidential palace. ||But the army denies this and says the Sudanese air force is attacking paramilitary bases. ||There have been calls from across the international community for the two sides to de-escalate this conflict and return to talks aimed at returning the country to civilian rule. ||Gunshots could be heard in the background of this news bulletin on state-run Sudan TV. ||The channel halted a news bulletin after the presenter began reading an item about the situation in Khartoum. ||"We hear gunshots and explosions and we are safe here in the studio," the presenter said before the programme abruptly ended and switched to songs about unity, peace and patriotism.||Lyrics including "let us remain as one" and "the skin colour is the same, the dialect is the same" were broadcast by the network.||The United Arab Emirates has called on all parties in Sudan to "exercise restraint" and "de-escalate and work towards ending this crisis through dialogue," the state news agency is reporting. ||Emirates News Agency (WAM) says the Emirati embassy in Khartoum is following developments in Sudan "with great concern" and has "reaffirmed the UAEs position on the importance of de-escalation, and working towards finding a peaceful solution to the crisis between the concerned parties".||"Furthermore, the embassy stresses the importance of efforts aimed at supporting the political process and achieving national consensus towards the formation of a government," the agency adds.||The fighting that has erupted in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country is a direct result of a vicious power struggle within the country's military leadership.||Since a coup in October 2021, Sudan has been run by a council of generals - and there are two military men at the centre of the dispute.||You can read more about their rivalry in our really simple guide to the current fighting.||More now from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who has called for the clashes in Sudan to end "immediately".||In a tweet, he said hewas "deeply concerned" about the reports of fighting. He added that USembassy staff in the capital, Khartoum, were all "currently accountedfor".||"We urge all actors tostop the violence immediately and avoid further escalations or troopmobilisations and continue talks to resolve outstanding issues," he said from Hanoi in Vietnam, on his way to a G7 foreign ministers' meeting in Japan.||We have got a bit more information about the civilian deaths in Khartoum we reported earlier.||The doctors' union which reported the deaths said three civilians had been killed at Khartoum Airport and in the neighbouring North Kordofan state.||In a statement on Facebook it added that at least nine other people were wounded in the clashes.||The statement did not specify how the two people died at the airport, which was the scene of earlier fighting as the regular army and paramilitaries battled for control, the AP news agency reports.|| || || || ||https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-65285254
Plymouth Argyle 'capable of going on to win the league' says boss Steven Schumacher||Plymouth Argyle boss Steven Schumacher feels his side are capable of winning League One after their Devon derby victory at Exeter City.||The 1-0 win put the Pilgrims top of League One as they battle with Sheffield Wednesday and Ipswich Town for the two automatic promotion places. ||It came after Argyle had lost two of their past three games, including a 4-0 defeat in the Papa Johns Trophy final.||"It felt important because it's a derby game," Schumacher told BBC Sport.||"It felt important because people have said a few things about us over the past few weeks, about not dealing with pressure.||"Well, there's no bigger pressure than this game today and the lads dealt with it, so to me that looked like a performance of a team who are capable of going on to win the league.||"We didn't play brilliantly, didn't play great football, but we found a way to win the game and were professional.||"It says a lot that if we can keep that standard up in the next five games then we've got a chance."||Matt Butcher's second-half goal, which deflected in off former Argyle defender Will Aimson, gave Argyle victory in a tense derby at St James Park.||It ensured they did the double over their big local rivals, having won 4-2 at Home Park at the end of October.||Schumacher says it is important that people look at the bigger picture rather than focus on the recent losses.||"The game that sticks out in everyone's mind is the Bolton game because it's in front of 80,000 people and it's a cup final, so that got amplified," he said.||"But that's six wins out of the past eight league games, so it's not a problem, everyone just needs to stay calm.||"I spoke about how I wasn't calm in my press conference on Saturday, but look at the bigger picture and we're top of the league - what more can we ask for?"||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now||https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65288100

Fishing could be finished for me and my young son||Callum Elliott is a fisherman on the west coast of Scotland but he's worried about the future for himself and his 18-month-old son Angus. ||His village of Tarbert in Argyll is built around the harbour and its small boats like Callum's trawler Sea Spray.||But in recent years the town has lost its chandlery, fish sales office and 60% of the fleet.||Local fishing grounds are being squeezed by a rise in the number of salmon farms, an expanding offshore wind sector and now by plans to protect the seabed by closing another 10% of the waters.||This fishing community has lived with the restriction of marine protected areas (MPAs) since 2016 but the Scottish government now proposes "highly protected" marine areas (HPMAs) where all commercial activity would be banned.||Callum says: "If we were left to do what we'd like to do under the rules and regulations that are currently in place there could be a great future but we need the government to work with us.||"If they carry on down the path they are, it's finished for me and it's finished for Angus."||The campaign group Open Seas wants better management plans which show clearly where the seas are protected and where fishing is allowed.||Callum, 37, comes from a farming background but felt the calling of the sea from a young age.  ||Ten years ago this week he took out a six-figure bank loan to buy his small trawler but feels there's now too little support for traditional fishing communities.||Cabling from wind turbines, seaweed farming and the presence of military bases have all heaped pressure on the same marine space meaning it's becoming squeezed.||Many fishermen feel they are being left the dregs once the seas have been divided up by other industries.||Callum says: "It used to be a job that, in my eyes, was respected but now you're almost ashamed to say that you're a fisherman."||Some believe restrictions are necessary and that a shift to "low impact" fishing would be beneficial to both the marine environment and the industry.||Bally Philp operates a creel boat out of Kyleakin harbour on the Isle of Skye and sells his high-value langoustines to restaurants across the UK.||Creel fishing can be described as "low-impact" and involves leaving pots on the seabed from which the prawns can't escape and then collecting them again when they are full.  ||He agrees with Callum that it is hard to invest in the industry when it is unclear what the future looks like.||But there the agreement between them ends because Bally would ban Callum's trawl boat from Scotland's inshore waters.||He advocates re-introducing a ban on trawling and dredging within three miles of the shore where the marine eco-system is most sensitive.||Bally says the fish stocks have dwindled through mismanagement of the seas and that creel fishing would be a more sustainable option. ||He says: "We use the space better than anyone else in terms of the amount of people that we can employ and the very small impact that we have on the marine environment.||"We shouldn't be competing with the likes of scallop dredgers or prawn trawlers. And if you get that right you can have fishing and conservation in the same space."||Prawns caught alive by creelers like Bally can be sold for as much as four times the value of the same shellfish caught in nets.||The campaign group Open Seas has published a report called Ease the Squeeze which examines how Scotland's waters could be divided up.||It says the Scottish government has failed to adequately implement spatial management plans which show clearly where the seas are protected and where fishing is allowed.||The report calls for a "robust and coherent" plan which includes areas designated as "Go Fish Zones" alongside conservation measures.||It says low impact fishing should be given prioritised access in those designated areas.||Nick Underdown from Open Seas told BBC Scotland: "The evidence is clear that over 80% of Scotland's seas are disturbed or highly disturbed and that needs addressed.||"The piecemeal of policies do not amount to a coherent spatial management plan which is what is required for our seas."||Thirty-year-old James Cameron has been diving for scallops for five years.||He lives in Staffin and is part of a three-strong tag-team which operates from a small dive boat out of Kyleakin.||If HPMAs are introduced in the area, he believes the business would become unviable.||He said: "We'd have to move the boat and we all live here. This is where our homes and families are. If it's not in this area, other boats would come in and that's a big pressure on us.||"We manage the grounds very carefully. If there were more boats moving into the area, all that planning falls apart."||Other industries say they too are feeling the squeeze from the increased demands on the marine space.||Salmon Scotland said it was worried it may have to move fish farms out of newly-protected areas while Scottish Renewables said its industry's expansion cannot happen in a way which treats other users of the sea unfairly.||A consultation on HPMAs ends next week.||The Scottish government said fairness must be at the heart of its plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and it had been engaging closely with the fishing industry.||A spokeswoman added: "Becoming net zero by 2045 will transform all sectors of our economy and society. But with careful planning and close working with communities, business, industry, we will ensure that this economic transformation is managed fairly for workers in existing industries."||Isles anger over plans to protect Scottish waters||Island families oppose marine protection areas||Marine reserves off England to get full protection||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Everton 1-3 Fulham: Second-half slump adds to hosts' relegation worries||Everton's hopes of Premier League survival suffered a blow as they were beaten by Fulham at Goodison Park.||Harrison Reed put the visitors ahead midway through the first half with a composed finish after Harry Wilson's curling shot had come back off the post.||The home side responded well though, levelling through Dwight McNeil's low drive 13 minutes later and ending the half in the ascendancy.||Sean Dyche's team began the second half quickly, too, but Fulham went ahead against the run of play on 51 minutes as Willian picked out Wilson with a lovely cushioned pass and the former Liverpool winger confidently found the corner.||Stunned by the goal, Everton lost their way and Daniel James extended Fulham's lead after 68 minutes, racing onto Kenny Tete's long ball and slotting past Jordan Pickford in the home goal.||Fulham could have scored more before Everton belatedly - and briefly - stirred again and attempted to rally late on.||However, Marco Silva's side held on comfortably to end a run of five successive defeats and leave Everton in 17th, above the drop zone only on goal difference.||Since Dyche's appointment, it is Everton's home form that has given them hope in their battle against relegation with wins over Arsenal, Leeds and Brentford as well as a last-gasp draw against Tottenham.||Those points may be vital come the end of the season, but aside from 15 minutes either side of half-time, there was little of the fight or intensity that led to those results as they succumbed to a Fulham side sat comfortably in midtable and in the midst of their worst run of the season.||Neither side offered much in a scrappy beginning but it was Fulham who provided the greater threat in the lead up to their opening goal.||The Blues took the knock well and should have been level through Neal Maupay, making a rare start, but the striker's close-range header was kept out by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno - albeit replays showed it may have been offside in any case.||The equaliser did come three minutes later, McNeil collecting James Garner's pass, slipping past Reed and arrowing the shot into the bottom corner to rouse a sunbathed Goodison Park.||In the 10 minutes before the break, it was all Everton and Maupay had the chance to put them in front after a one-two with McNeil, only to be thwarted by Leno again.||A bright start to the second half, in which McNeil's mishit cross hit the outside of the post, kept the home crowd's decibel level up but the energy of both fans and home players evaporated after Wilson's goal.||Having fought back once, Everton seemed to lack the belief that they could do so again. James got Fulham's third and even with more than 20 minutes to go, both sides seemed sure the game was over as a contest.||With seven games to go, Dyche's side cannot afford to repeat the sort of listless performance they delivered for much of this game - and certainly not at home.||After such a positive season, it had been a tough few weeks for Fulham with five defeats on the bounce, including a very public implosion at Manchester United that left them without top-scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic for eight matches.||That run may have seen them slip out of contention for European qualification but it is hard to think that there is anyone associated with the west London club who would not have been thrilled with the prospect of sitting pretty in 10th at this stage of the campaign.||Nevertheless, losing can be a tough habit to break and in ending their winless streak, Fulham took a big step towards ensuring such an encouraging season does not end with a whimper.||Cottagers manager Silva was sat in the stands as he completed his touchline ban to see his current side outplay his former team for long spells.||Reed buzzed around relentlessly in midfield alongside Joao Palhinha while further forward Willian, seemingly always in space, threatened throughout, James was a constant nuisance to the Everton defence and, buoyed by his goal, Wilson's quality was clear as Fulham overwhelmed their hosts at times in the second half.||In this most enjoyable of seasons for Fulham, this was an afternoon to savour in the Merseyside sunshine.||Player of the match||WilsonHarry Wilson||4.90||4.67||4.56||4.40||4.33||4.31||4.27||4.16||4.11||4.10||3.99||3.72||3.61||2.90||7.75||7.73||7.54||7.34||7.27||7.17||7.11||7.05||7.04||7.04||7.03||6.90||6.88||6.81||6.77||Formation  4-4-2||Formation  4-2-3-1||Match ends, Everton 1, Fulham 3.||Second Half ends, Everton 1, Fulham 3.||Corner,  Fulham.

Who is Disney star Noah Matthews Matofsky?||You may have seen the trailers for the hotly anticipated Disney blockbuster, Peter Pan and Wendy. ||The big-budget film stars Jude Law, who plays Dumbledore in the Fantastic Beasts movies, but there is one other cast member making a name for himself this year. ||Noah Matthews Matofsky is a 15-year-old actor and model, who plays Slightly, the leader of the Lost Boys in Neverland. ||Noah is described by his talent agency as confident, infectiously loveable and a natural team player. ||He also has a genetic condition called Down's syndrome, which usually affects someone's learning and their physical features.|| What causes Down's syndrome?||Noah's Mum said he had to go through a long audition process, but was chosen from thousands of young actors and is now making history as one of the first actors with Down's syndrome to play a lead role in a Disney movie! ||He told The Sun newspaper that filming was an "amazing experience" and that one of the perks of the job was learning sword fighting and having his own trailer - which is a bit like a posh private caravan where movie stars can relax between filming scenes. ||Noah spent around six months filming in two different locations in Canada - Vancouver and Newfoundland. ||On the set, he made lots of fantastic friends, and said one of the best days was when megastar Jude Law, who plays the menacing Captain Hook, surprised him and his fellow young actors by hiring an ice cream truck with all their favourite flavours!||"I had lots of lines to learn very quickly, but it was exciting and I really enjoyed it" said Noah. ||His Mum Kathryn said, "As captain of the Lost Boys, Noah's character Slightly shows that Down syndrome never needs to hold you back. It's not a learning difficulty  it's a learning difference, and we should embrace differences."||Noah is back at school and says everyone is excited about his new career. ||"My friends loved the trailer and give me amazing compliments! A million people have asked for my autograph. I'm a bit of a hero."||Noah has recently been named an ambassador for charity Down Syndrome UK and wants to prove that having the condition shouldn't hold anyone back.||What is your favourite animated film of all time?||Are you celebrating World Down Syndrome Day?||Watch Newsround.

Yemen war: Major prisoner swap raises hopes||A major prisoner swap between warring sides in Yemen is under way, seen as part of stepped-up efforts to end the devastating eight-year conflict there.||Red Cross officials said 318 prisoners had been flown on four flights between the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, and government-held Aden.||About 900 prisoners are expected to be exchanged over the next three days.||The war between rebels and pro-government Saudi-led forces has left tens of thousands of Yemenis dead.||It has also created what the UN has called one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with some 80% of the population forced to rely on food aid to survive.||The exchange - the largest since late 2020 - is seen as a confidence-building measure, following talks earlier this week in Sanaa between a Saudi delegation and Houthi rebels aimed at reaching a new and potentially permanent ceasefire.||The talks were facilitated by Oman, which shares a border with both Saudi Arabia and Yemen and has played a key role in attempts to broker an end to the fighting for years.||There has been increased momentum towards ending the war since Saudi Arabia and the Houthis resumed direct on-off talks last year. Hopes were furthered when Saudi Arabia and its powerful rival Iran - the Houthis' main backer - agreed last month to restore relations after a bitter seven-year rift.||Despite the failure to renew a UN-brokered six-month ceasefire in October, there has been a sharp decline in fighting, accompanied by some steps to ease tensions. They include the easing of restrictions on imports and prisoner exchanges, agreed in negotiations in Switzerland last month.||There are believed to be thousands of prisoners held by both sides.||"With this act of goodwill, hundreds of families torn apart by conflict are being reunited during the holy month of Ramadan, providing a glimmer of hope amidst great suffering," said Fabrizio Carboni, regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).||Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the west of the country.||President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi fled abroad and a Saudi-led alliance of Arab states intervened to restore his rule. However, years of military stalemate have followed.||The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and more than 23 million people - three-quarters of the population - in need of some form of aid.||Saudi-Houthi talks bring hope of Yemen ceasefire||Hundreds of child soldiers dead in Yemen war - UN||Saudi Arabia proposes Yemen peace plan||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Abused gay men don't see they are victims - study||Gay and bisexual men are being abused by romantic partners but face multiple barriers to support, according to recent studies.||Research from Glasgow Caledonian University found that one in four men experienced violence in same-sex relationships. ||It heard from victims who shared sometimes harrowing accounts of abuse including physical violence, rape and psychological abuse from both casual and longer-term partners.||Academics have called for more awareness around the subject and improvements to support services to help prevent "generations" of men facing the same problems.||Dr Edgar Rodriguez-Dorans is a counsellor and lectures in counselling and psychotherapy at the University of Edinburgh.||Originally from Mexico, he has lived in Scotland since 2013 and has dealt with a number of gay and bisexual clients who have suffered a wide range of traumatic experiences in relationships.||A common factor among those who have experienced sexual abuse, he said, is the issue of consent being understood by either victim or abuser.||One client told Dr Rodriguez-Dorans he repeatedly allowed his boyfriend to have sex with him when he did not want to because he felt "he needed to be available" to him.||Another man, he said, told of an experience at a "chemsex" party - where people use drugs such as methamphetamine, mephedrone ("meow meow") or GHB (gammahydroxybutrate) to enhance sex.||"The drugs were too strong so he was unable to be fully conscious," said Dr Rodriguez-Dorans. "He didn't want to continue in the party."||After refusing sex from the men present, the man was raped.||Dr Rodriguez-Dorans said because his client was an immigrant, he did not think police would believe him if he reported the incident.||"It's something he has realised is part of his domestic life," he said. "Partners have taken it as some sort of kink - like they say no, it's a bit forceful, it's fun."||Part of the problem, according to the counsellor, is that the lives of gay men have been "hyper-sexualised" and they often relate to each other through sexual activity.||He said: "Feeling empowered by sexuality, that is fine, but it can create a dynamic where they are not sure whether they're having sex when they want to."||Another man told Dr Rodriguez-Dorans he reported his violent ex-boyfriend to police, but was told there was "not enough evidence to suggest he was in danger".||The abuser initially refused to move out of the man's flat and sent him threatening messages - which the man showed to officers.||He also repeatedly stood outside the victim's flat, which Dr Rodriguez-Dorans described as "overt intimidation".||"We were working on agoraphobia," he said. "He would not be able to go out at night - he would be terrified and go back to the safety of his home. He was also dealing with panic attacks on a regular basis.||"We are still working on this and it's been years since the client left the relationship - that's very important, the relationship might have ended years ago but the effects continue."||In terms of access to support services, Dr Rodriguez-Dorans said the barriers were complex.||Many are targeted towards women, which he said gives the narrative that women are "more prone to be victims" of abuse.||Meanwhile charities and mental health services for LGBT people are also overstretched.||But perhaps most pervasively, many of Dr Rodriguez-Dorans' cases are affected by misconceptions on masculinity.||"Men don't see themselves as objects of abuse," he said. "People who have been victims of sexual abuse can take up to 20 years to actually seek help."||On those perpetrating the abuse, he added: "Many might be dealing with internalised homophobia, shame, isolation from their families and emotional illiteracy - which is quite widespread among men regardless of their sexuality.||"Exercising power against their partner might put them in position where they feel like their masculinity is asserted."||Similar experiences of abuse among gay and bisexual men have been demonstrated in two pieces of research by Glasgow Caledonian University, which will be presented to the Scottish government's LGBTI+ cross-party group later this month.||The first, published in 2020, was a UK-wide survey which found one in four gay or bisexual men experienced intimate partner violence (IPV).||The second study, published last year, interviewed 10 men aged between 26 to 47 in Scotland on their experiences of domestic abuse.||It highlighted that the "absence of a rape narrative" for men in same-sex relationships made it difficult for some to recognise when they had been sexually assaulted.||It also said men with big muscular bodies worried that "appearing 'acceptably' masculine" might make others doubt that they were victims of IPV.||Lead academics Prof Jamie Frankis and Dr Steven Maxwell have called the problem an "urgent public health issue".||Dr Maxwell said: "IPV experienced by GBM and wider LGBTQ+ folk is an issue that many are unaware of. Our research found that IPV has a detrimental impact on an individual's health, both in the short and long term, and can cause mental ill health including anxiety, PTSD, depression and suicidality. ||"We hope that this research will help bridge the knowledge gap, increase public awareness and lead to policy change at a national level."||Dr Rodriguez-Dorans added that more training was needed to help police officers recognise signs of domestic abuse in same-sex relationships.||"If we don't address these issues, it won't change," he said. "We'll end up with generation after generation going down the same path."||Det Ch Supt Sam Faulds of Police Scotland said tackling domestic abuse remains a "significant priority".||She said the force responds to all reports, adding: "Whilst we recognise the disproportionate impact on women and girls, the definition of domestic abuse is not gender specific. ||"It is a despicable and debilitating crime which affects all our communities and has no respect for ability, age, ethnicity, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation."||The tragedy that 'chemsex' drugs can cause||My rapist told me 'all gay men are the same'||Gay and bisexual men's health survey 2020||Violent experiences of men in same-sex relationships||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Titanic ship plan could sell for 200k at auction||A plan of the Titanic used in the inquiry into the sinking of the ship could sell for more than 200,000 at auction.||The 33ft (10m) cross-section plan was commissioned by the British Board of Trade to assist in the 36-day hearing.||It was bought by a private collector in 2011 for 220,000, which was then a world record for Titanic memorabilia.||It has been on public display in Belfast since 2012 and is set to be sold on 22 April in Devizes, Wiltshire.||The hand-drawn plan of the Titanic was prepared by White Star Line architects for the British inquiry into the sinking of the ship, just weeks after the disaster. ||It allowed the 96 witnesses called to testify to indicate various parts of the ship using a point and has original chalk marks showing what happened.||Investigators concluded the 1912 tragedy, in which more than 1,500 passengers lost their lives, was brought about by "excessive speed".||Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge from Henry Aldridge and Son Ltd said: "It is a magnificent and commanding piece, both historically and visually.||"It eclipses anything we have seen on the market for Titanic in terms of size, and most importantly it has undergone an extensive process of archival stabilisation."||Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Canary Wharf: Spectacular photos of skyscraper rediscovered||Spectacular photographs of a Canary Wharf skyscraper being completed have been rediscovered more than 30 years after they were taken.||Amid strong winds, Tony Brien sat in a wooden box suspended by a crane some 250m above east London to capture the images of One Canada Square.||Previously believed to have been lost, the photographs were uncovered during a search of Mr Brien's archives.||He said he was "completely staggered" to find the photos from November 1990.||Mr Brien said he had worked on the Canary Wharf project before when he was approached to photograph the "topping out" of One Canada Square.||"I said 'fine', not realising quite at that time that the only way I could really do it was to go up in a bucket or a crate from the ground which was attached to a crane," he explained.||Mr Brien, from Felsted in Essex, said there were concerns about his safety on the day the pyramid was laid on top of the building, because of the strong winds.||He said: "I was waiting in the wind, hanging in this bucket, effectively, with every camera you could shake a stick at."||"They had attached to it the union flag, United States flag and the Canadian flag," he said. ||"It was all knotted up and I shouted across to him (a construction worker) 60ft away: 'Can you pull the flag out?' And he's tugging away trying to do it and then he eventually pulled the flag out.||"The images with that moment and the steel workers grappling with this - I don't know what it weighed, but quite a bit - hanging from another crane, was quite a scene."||Mr Brien explained that because he had moved studios several times, he thought he had lost the photos until six months ago. ||"I was hunting for something else and I came across them and was completely staggered," he said.||"I'd often thought about the images and thought it was a terrible tragedy that they had never been seen. And to find them; I literally had to sit down... Thankfully I'd kept them properly and they were fine."||All images subject to copyright ||Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Grand National: Nine arrested after protesters delay start of race||Nine people were arrested after protesters delayed the start of the Grand National on Saturday by getting onto the racecourse at Aintree.||Merseyside Police said "a large number of protesters attempted to gain entry" to the course just after 17:00 BST.||While the "majority" were stopped, nine managed to enter the track and were later arrested by officers, a statement added.||The race started at 17:29 after having been scheduled to begin at 17:15.||The 175th edition was won by Corach Rambler, ridden by Derek Fox.||Television pictures appeared to show some protesters making it onto the track and trying to attach themselves to a fence, before being removed by police.||Others attempted to climb over or glue themselves to security fencing around the track but were led away, with police also confiscating ladders.||After a delay was announced on the racecourse public address system, the 39 participating horses were taken back to the pre-parade ring.||The jockeys were asked to re-mount their rides six minutes after the scheduled start time, with the race starting eight minutes later.||"We can confirm that nine people have been arrested at Aintree Racecourse today (Saturday 15 April)," Merseyside Police said.||"Just after 5pm a large number of protesters attempted to gain entry on to the course.||"The majority were prevented from breaching the boundary fencing but the nine individuals who managed to enter the course were later arrested by officers."||Three people were earlier arrested in connection with potential co-ordinated disruption activities.||A 25-year-old woman from London and a man were arrested outside Aintree on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance.||A 33-year-old woman from the London area was arrested in Greater Manchester on suspicion of the same offence.||Climate and animal rights group Animal Rising claimed one of those arrested earlier on Saturday was one of its members, 25-year-old Claudia Penna Rojas.||Merseyside Police said they had planned for the possibility of protests.||Around 30 animal rights protesters had gathered outside the racecourse on Saturday morning.||The police had previously said they would deal "robustly" with any disruption after animal rights activists threatened to sabotage the race.||Before the race, a spokesperson said: "We are continuing to work with The Jockey Club and other partners to keep people safe during the Grand National Festival.||"We are aware of some people planning to protest at the event. This has been factored into our plans.||"We respect the right to peaceful protest and expression of views, but criminal behaviour and disorder will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly."||Aintree Racecourse warned that the actions of protestors could "endanger the horses they purport to protect, as well as jockeys, officials and themselves".||Animal Rising spokesperson Nathan McGovern said: "Police are wasting time chasing protesters rather than addressing the climate and ecological emergency, and our broken relationship to animals. ||"We remain undeterred, and we will peacefully continue our actions to stop harm coming to animals at Aintree.||"Today marks the first of many actions that will really take place this summer to push this conversation to the top of the agenda."||Animal Rising posted photos on social media appearing to show supporters slow-marching around Aintree on Saturday afternoon.||There have been two horse deaths at the 2023 meeting. Envoye Special suffered a fatal injury in the Foxhunters' Chase on Thursday, then Dark Raven was put down following a fall during the Turners Mersey Novices' Hurdle on Saturday.||The Jockey Club said: "While racing in the third race, Dark Raven was immediately attended by our expert veterinary professionals.||"After assessment, sadly they concluded the necessary course of action for the horse's welfare was to put him to sleep. Our sincere sympathies are with his connections."||Bookmakers expect more than 150m to be wagered on the National, which takes place over 30 fences and four and a quarter miles.||How to get into horse riding, whether you want to work with horses at the stables or become a fully fledged jockey.||Latest updates and video from the world of equestrian sports||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com/sport/horse-racing/65285510

Texas dairy farm explosion kills 18,000 cows||Approximately 18,000 cows were killed in a blast at a Texas dairy farm earlier this week, according to local authorities.  ||The explosion, at South Fork Dairy near the town of Dimmitt, also left one person in critical condition. ||Authorities believe that machinery in the facility may have ignited methane gas. ||Nearly three million farm animals died in fires across the US between 2018 and 2021. ||Castro County Sheriff's Office said they had received a report of a fire at the farm at about 19:21 on Monday (00:21 GMT Tuesday). ||Photos posted by the Sheriff's Office show a huge plume of black smoke rising from the ground. ||When police and emergency personnel arrived at the scene, they found one person trapped who had to be rescued and flown to hospital in critical condition. ||While the exact figure of cows that were killed by fire and smoke remains unknown, the Sheriff's Office told the BBC that an "estimated 18,000 head of cattle" had been lost. ||Speaking to local news outlet KFDA, Sheriff Sal Rivera said that most of the cattle had been lost after the blaze spread to an area in which cows were held before being taken to a milking area and then into a holding pen.||"There's some that survived," he was quoted as saying. "There's some that are probably injured to the point where they'll have to be destroyed." ||Mr Rivera told KFDA that investigators believed the fire might have started with a machine referred to as a "honey badger", which he described as "vacuum that sucks the manure and water out". ||"Possibly [it] got overheated and probably the methane and things like that ignited and spread out and exploded," he said. ||In a statement sent to the BBC,  the Washington DC-based Animal Welfare Institute said that - if confirmed - a death toll of 18,000 cows would be "by far" the deadliest barn fire involving cattle since it began keeping statistics in 2013. ||"We hope the industry will remain focused on this issue and strongly encourage farms to adopt common sense fire safety measures," said Allie Granger, policy associate for AWI's farm animal program. "It is hard to imagine anything worse than being burned alive."||According to the AWI, nearly 6.5m farm animals have been killed in barn fires since 2013, of which about 6m were chickens and about 7,300 were cows. ||Between 2018 and 2021, nearly 3 million farm animals died in fire, with 1.76m chickens dying in the six largest fires over that time period. ||Firefighters tackle suspected arson attack at barn||Young farmer in tears after TB hits 55 cows||Australia crop exports set for record after rains||'Farms are going to need different kinds of robots'||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Hearts see Naismith as their Robson figure - Levein||Former Hearts manager Craig Levein reckons Steven Naismith's appointment as interim boss was influenced by Aberdeen's resurgence under Barry Robson.||I think what Hearts have done is look at Aberdeen, and see the success that Barry Robson has had there," Levein told the BBC's Scottish Football Podcast.||Its quite interesting because Ive obviously worked with both of them, I had Barry at Dundee United and Steven at Scotland and Hearts.||They both have quite a, and Ive got to use the right phrase here, I was going to say mean streak but its probably not that, but ruthless to a degree.||They played the game in a manner that was all about winning and they wouldnt hesitate to use any dirty tricks that they needed to win a match.||So theyre quite similar in that regard, theres a lot they aren't similar in but in that regard, the will to win, and to do almost anything to get a win was something that, as a manager, I was really pleased they were in my team.||I think Hearts have looked at the situation at Aberdeen and thought, 'Weve got a Barry Robson in the dressing room here in the shape of Steven Naismith and perhaps he could do the same thing that Barrys doing.'||Because really this is about one thing and that is qualifying again to play in the European stage and to try, on an annual basis, to have 5m or 6m or more if they can manage to get through the group stages."||Corach Rambler wins Grand National after protesters delay start||Premier League: Haaland double puts Man City three up||Women's FA Cup semi-final: Man Utd pull level against Brighton||Who is the greatest football pundit of all times?||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Whats gone wrong with our housing?||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Can they tell the nice guys from the money chasers?||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Have a thrilling movie night tonight!||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now||Pinstickers' guide to the Grand National||Runners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.||Gadirova takes gold in dramatic all-around final.

China: Dior accused of racism over 'pulled eye' advertisement||Luxury brand Dior has been accused of racism on Chinese social media over an advertisement showing an Asian model pulling up the corner of her eye.||The French label posted the picture on its Instagram account earlier this week, before swiftly taking it down.||Dior has not made any public comment. The BBC has asked them for a response.||Chinese netizens have become increasingly sensitive to the depiction of Chinese people amid rising nationalist sentiment online.||The controversial picture was posted six days ago to promote Dior's new makeup collection. It shows the model pulling up her eye with the caption "Channel your feline fierceness". ||It was later reposted by netizens on Chinese social media platforms, where it received criticism and sparked the viral hashtag "Dior makeup advertisement accused of discriminating against Asians" on Weibo.||Angry comments have also flooded the label's Instagram account. "It's racial discrimination," a top-liked comment reads.||"Are you trying to make money and play racism at the same time?" a Chinese user posted.||State-owned newspaper Global Times published an editorial calling on the brand to apologise. ||"'Pulling your eyes back'... makes fun of the appearance of Asians, especially East Asians," it said. "We hope that Dior can face up to its mistakes, make a sincere apology and response to Asian society, and make clear statements on how to prevent similar problems from happening in the future."||Some netizens have also called on Chinese celebrities who model for Dior to end their association with the brand.||But there are also some who think the discussion is over the top.||"An extreme unconfident person won't be able to take any level of humour," one Weibo user wrote.||"Those who buy Dior never think it insults China, it's always those who don't buy that are concerned by it," another one said.||This is not the first time Dior has been caught up in controversy in China, one of its biggest markets.||A Chinese fashion photographer's picture for the brand sparked outrage in 2021 after some netizens said it perpetuated Western stereotypes of Asian faces. The photographer later apologised and Dior said it "respects the sentiments of the Chinese people".||In 2022, Dior was accused of "culturally appropriating" a Chinese traditional design for one of its skirts.||A Chinese snack brand was also previously accused of racism for using a model with narrow eyes in its advertisements.||China: Why some think 'small eyes' are not pretty||Photographer sorry for 'small eyes' Dior picture||Freckles accused of insulting China||D&G cancels show amid racism accusations||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

County Championship: Ollie Pope hits unbeaten 48 for Surrey against Hampshire||A truncated second day's play at the Kia Oval only allowed Surrey to move to 153-4 in reply to Hampshire's first-innings 254 in their County Championship game, with England's Ollie Pope unbeaten on 48.||Surrey lost the wickets of Dom Sibley, Rory Burns, Ryan Patel and Jordan Clark in the 43.3 overs bowled across four separate sessions before play was eventually called off at 18:10 BST - just over half an hour after the players had left the field for what proved to be the final time.||Rain meant only 25 minutes' play was initially possible in the morning session, ahead of an early lunch, in which Burns and Sibley added just five more runs to Surrey's overnight 37 without loss.||But a restart at 13:25 almost immediately brought a first success for Hampshire's quicker bowlers, with Sibley (16) edging the metronomic Mohammad Abbas to Liam Dawson at second slip from the seventh ball of the afternoon.||Pope was comprehensively beaten by the second ball he faced, from Pakistan international Abbas, and on four edged Keith Barker at catchable height straight between first and second slips.||Surrey captain Burns, who had resumed on 23, fell for a well-made 45 when Abbas came from around the wicket to produce a fine ball which forced the left-hander to thin-edge to keeper Ben Brown.||New batter Patel initially struggled to get going against tight bowling from both Abbas and Kyle Abbott, but he then took 10 runs from three balls off Ian Holland's medium pace and also produced a lovely extra cover-driven four off Abbott.||On 20, however, Patel edged a drive at James Fuller and saw James Vince cling on to a sharp tumbling catch at chest height at first slip.||Pope, having flipped Fuller's first ball off his pads for his fourth boundary earlier in that over, was joined by Clark, who almost chopped his second ball - from Holland - into his stumps just before the players went off for a second time at 15:15.||After resuming at 15:45, following an early tea, only two more overs were bowled before bad light intervened again, with Clark's clip past midwicket off Abbas for two the only scoring shot.||An hour later, at 16:55, the players emerged again for a final mini-session of 9.3 overs in which Clark was lbw to an Abbott nip-backer for three before Pope and Jamie Smith (nine not out) hung in determinedly while also playing the two strokes of the shortened day to take Surrey to within 101 runs of Hampshire's total.||Smith clipped Abbas powerfully wide on mid on for four and Pope then danced down the pitch to drive Abbott with a flourish to the extra cover ropes, but the light soon became unplayable again and no more cricket was possible.||Abbas, with figures of 21-7-39-2, bowled testingly throughout in the bowler-friendly conditions and Abbott was not far behind him with 1-35 from his 15 overs overall.||Match report supplied by the ECB Reporters' Network.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

Legal challenge launched over autism assessment changes in Bristol||Campaigners have started legal action to reverse a decision to reduce the number of children eligible for an autism diagnosis via NHS services.||Sirona, which runs the service in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, said it had to narrow criteria due to a 350% rise in demand. ||Assess for Autism has raised 5,000 through a crowd funding campaign to challenge the change.||Sirona said it recognised concerns but said its decision was "clinically-led". ||On Thursday, lawyers for Assess for Autism sent Sirona a "letter before action" - the first step of legal proceedings to try to overturn the decision.  ||Jai Breitnauer, one of the founders of the campaign, has one son with a diagnosis of autism and a second waiting to be assessed. ||She said Assess for Autism's campaign had received an "outpouring of support" and had hit its fundraising target in 10 days. ||Ms Breitnauer said the campaign was considering launching a judicial review if Sirona does not engage. ||"We have sympathy for NHS services locally and nationally which we know are underfunded" she said.||"However, we take great issue with that idea that this is a clinically-led decision. The decision doesn't seem to follow NHS guidelines.||"It is (Sirona) saying 'we can't afford everybody so we are going to see the children that have already started falling off the edge of the cliff and try and catch them if we can'.|| "We don't think that's a good way to be operating services. It is definitely not in the spirit of the NHS," added Ms Breitnauer. ||Assess for Autism said it wanted to know if there were other cost-savings Sirona could have made before it decided to scale back services. ||Ms Breitnauer said it had been difficult to secure an assessment for her younger son.||"He doesn't meet any of Sirona's criteria but that doesn't mean he isn't struggling.||"He is finding school hard, he's finding social interaction hard - his anxiety is sky high and he doesn't really understand why he feels the way he does," she said.||"We have said to him the likelihood is that he is autistic. But until we have a diagnosis it is hard to know what services we can access," added Ms Breitnauer.||Sirona said it was undertaking a system-wide review of its services and feedback would be considered.||A spokesperson said: "Faced with a dramatic increase in demand for referrals in recent years... we have taken a clinically-led decision to prioritise access for children whose needs are greatest.||"We are talking daily to families to give support and have been attending events to explain the background to the changes and listen to people about their concerns.||"We are keen to work with partners to ensure neurodiversity is recognised and understood and that we all work together to ensure we meet the needs of children and young people." ||Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

SNP ruling body orders governance and transparency review||This video can not be played||Party leader Humza Yousaf said there would be "external input" into the review||The SNP's ruling body has ordered a review of transparency and the way the party is managed after recent controversy over its finances. ||The National Executive Committee (NEC) met on Saturday amid a police probe and a row over the release of membership numbers.||Party leader Humza Yousaf said a new working group would publish an interim report in June.||It will be followed by a full report ahead of the SNP's autumn conference.||Asked if the review would go far enough, Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland: "It is important that the financial oversight that we are committed to improving comes from the external input as opposed to within the party."||Last week Mr Yousaf revealed that he had been unware until he became leader that the SNP's auditors had resigned more than six months ago. ||The firm Johnston Carmichael quit last September, and there is concern the party may be unable to conduct an audit due in July.||On Thursday, the new SNP leader and first minister also said he only recently learned that the SNP had bought a luxury motorhome.||It was seized by police from outside a property in Dunfermline as part of an investigation into the party's finances. ||Former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, who is Nicola Sturgeon's husband, was also arrested on 5 April while their home was searched. He was later released without charge.||Mr Murrell resigned from his SNP position last month after misleading statements about party membership numbers were given to a journalist.||On Saturday the NEC approved proposals for the appointment of a new chief executive through an "open and transparent" external recruitment process.||Prior to the NEC meeting, one committee member had suggested he might resign unless "forensic auditors" were appointed to examine the party's finances. A forensic audit is used to uncover evidence that could be used in a court of law. ||Bill Ramsay, the SNP trade union group convener, said: "I have been raising issues about the governance of the party for some time." ||He added: "If the call to appoint forensic auditors is not moved forward, I will have to seriously consider whether I can continue on the NEC."||On Saturday Mr Yousaf dismissed speculation that the SNP could be facing bankruptcy. He replied: "It's not. The party is solvent."||The police investigation follows complaints about how the party spent more than 600,000 of donations that it received from activists to fund a future independence referendum campaign. ||Questions were raised after accounts showed the SNP had just under 97,000 in the bank at the end of 2019, and total net assets of about 272,000.||Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf was in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency on Saturday, where there is the prospect of a by-election.||Margaret Ferrier won the seat for the SNP in 2019 - but was later found to have damaged the reputation of the Commons and placed people at risk by taking part in a debate and travelling by train after testing positive for Covid-19. She now sits as an independent.||If she is barred from the Commons for 10 days or more, that could trigger a recall petition, which would result in a by-election in the constituency - although 10% of voters there would need to support this for it to go ahead.||Mr Yousaf told the BBC the party took "decisive action" against Margaret Ferrier at the time, which he supported.||He added: "We want there to be a by-election. We will support the recall petition.||"We have got a really strong track record, not just what we have delivered for this constituency but what we have delivered for the people of Scotland." ||Yousaf told of SNP motorhome after becoming leader||Ex-minister tells SNP to hire forensic accountants||Ex-SNP chief will not be suspended from party - FM||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Irish Premiership: Glens beat Reds to go third as Ports defeat Carrick||Glentoran eased to a 3-0 win over Cliftonville which sees the Oval side go third in the Premiership.||Linfield tightened their grip on second place with a 1-0 victory at Coleraine while Glenavon edged Newry City 1-0 to seal the final European play-off spot.||Bottom side Portadown are now just two points behind Dungannon Swifts after beating Carrick Rangers 2-0 while the Swifts lost 2-0 at Ballymena United.||Loughgall defeated Dundela 3-1 to seal promotion to the Premiership. ||A Bobby Burns double helped Glentoran leapfrog the Reds into third spot with a comfortable win at the Oval. ||Junior Uzokwe scored his first goal for the east Belfast side after the forward got the better of Odhran Casey before slotting past Gerard Doherty on the 19th minute.||Burns doubled the Glens lead after the former Hearts man struck first-time into the bottom corner following Conor McMenamin's pull-back. ||And the double was completed on the stroke of half-time after rifling into Doherty's top corner after McMenamin was dispossessed in the Cliftonville penalty area. ||Things could have got even better for Rodney McAree's men in the first half with Niall McGinn striking the outside of the post following a shot from distance after Doherty's clearance. ||Glentoran weathered early Cliftonville pressure in the second half when Ronan and Rory Hale had chances to pull one back before the Glens reaffirmed their dominance. ||The hosts should have had a penalty when Doherty bundled over Junior in the box before substitute Danny Purkis missed two gilt-edged chances in a matter of minutes with the second seeing the former Glenavon man shoot over the bar yards from goal.||Linfield claimed a vital three points in the battle for second place and automatic European qualification with this narrow victory at Coleraine. ||The Blues had the first real opening when Chris Shield advanced forward from midfield and his 25-yard shot was pushed away at full stretch by Gareth Deane.||Kirk Millar flashed a shot wide for the visitors before Eetu Vertainen wriggled his way into the Coleraine penalty area and teed up Matthew Clarke, but the full-back could only scoop his shot over.||Coleraine's best opening of the first half came when Conor McKendry swung in a dangerous cross and Jimmy Callacher, under pressure from Matthew Shevlin, headed the ball narrowly wide of his own post.||The best move of the second period came from the home side on 70 minutes when Andy Scott cut in from the left and his curling shot looked to be dipping in to the top corner but Chris Johns brilliantly flicked the effort over with an outstretched hand.||The decisive moment came with three minutes left when Kyle Lafferty's cross was half-cleared as far as substitute Niall Quinn, who drilled a shot through a crowded goalmouth and past Gareth Deane.||Glenavon secured seventh place and a spot in the European play-offs after Jack Malone's second-half goal was enough to beat Newry. ||The midfielder drilled a low shot past Steven Maguire just after the hour mark after Newry failed to clear a cross, but it was a rare moment of quality in an otherwise drab game at the Showgrounds.||Glenavon struggled to piece anything together in a disjointed first half, and it was Newry who looked the more threatening. ||Olajuwon Adeyemo came closest to breaking the deadlock, but his shot from the edge of the penalty area came back off the post. ||Glenavon improved after the break and Matthew Fitzpatrick had a header saved before Malone's decisive strike. ||Jamie Doran had a late effort saved, but Newry rarely looked like getting themselves back into the game. The defeat keeps Newry in the relegation fight, five points above 11th-placed Dungannon with two games remaining. ||Two late goals gave Ballymena their first three league points since 14 January.||The Sky Blues opened the scoring on the 87th minute when David McDaid skilfully passed the ball across the box to Jordan Gibson, who fired home from close range.||In additional time Kym Nelson's strike from 40-yards out added more suffering to a deflated Dungannon side when his shot looped over Declan Dunne.||Dean Shiels' men had a flurry of chances to score in the first half and they were to be punished for their wasteful finishing. ||Their best opportunity came when James Knowles' dangerous corner was originally cleared, but only back to the midfielder, who played the ball back into the box before Michael O'Connor took a strong strike. However, Ross Redman cleared the danger off the line.  ||Jordan Williamson saved Cahal McGinty's header and then Marc Walsh's strike from the edge of the box in the opening 45 minutes.||At the other end, McDaid latched onto Jordan Gibson's pass with his resulting strike being deflected by Dunne before Steven Scott made the final goal-line clearance to deny the Sky Blues' top-scorer his seventh league goal of the season.||The second half was a more even affair and Ballymena should have netted on 57 minutes when eventual scorer Gibson was left one-on-one after McDaid again played an unselfish ball to the forward, but Dunne skilfully palmed the strike away. ||In the final 10 minutes Mikey Place nodded Kym Nelson's pass goal-bound but once again Dunne made the save.||Portadown got back to winning ways with the Shamrock Park win over Carrick to keep their hopes alive of avoiding relegation. ||Two goals from Cathair Friel and a Josh Archer strike gave the Co Armagh side the three points while Ben Tilney netted Carrick's goal on 59 minutes.||Portadown opened the scoring on the 14th minute when Friel's curling free-kick from 25 yards found the bottom right corner.||On 32 minutes the hosts doubled their lead when Archer made the most of a defensive error by Jim Ervin, rounded Ross Glendinning and slotted into an empty net.||Friel scored his second on 86 minutes as he fired hard and low into the bottom left corner after receiving a pass from Alan O'Sullivan.||Carrick did have chances in the first half with David Cushley's header on the 30th minute tested the hands of Jethren Barr.||Carrick pulled a goal back when Tilney reacted quickest to a Lloyd Anderson shot that was pushed out to Tilney.||Rangers pushed for an equaliser and on 80 minutes they nearly got it when Alexander Gawne's close-range effort was cleared of the line. The result, combined with Dungannon's defeat,  means Portadown can still escape automatic relegation.||Northern Ireland are left to rue missed chances and a disallowed goal as Finland deliver an early blow to their Euro 2024 qualification hopes with a 1-0 win in Belfast.||Armagh are relegated from Division One of the Allianz Football League as they lose 0-18 to 0-16 at Omagh and Monaghan beat Mayo 2-14 to 0-14.||American Sam Burns wins the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play Championship after Rory McIlroy suffers dramatic semi-final defeat.||https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65287059
George Munsey: Injured Scotland batter 'will make World Cup qualifier', says coach Doug Watson||Key batter George Munsey will be with Scotland's squad for June's ICC World Cup qualifier in Zimbabwe despite a broken little finger, says new interim head coach Doug Watson.||The 30-year-old opener was injured during their training camp in Antigua this week.||It means he will miss the annual Cool & Smooth T20 competition starting there.||Asked if Munsey will recover for Zimbabwe, Watson said: "He'll be there even if his fingers are still sore." ||The 49-year-old South African added: "He's pretty fired up and determined to do well for Scotland and he's an integral part of the team."||Six of the Scotland squad are remaining in Antigua to take part in the Cool & Smooth T20, in which Munsey was top run scorer last year, with players assigned to eight teams on a roster basis.||Watson will remain in Antigua to monitor their progress and added: "It's a great opportunity for them to not only improve their skills but also be involved in different environments, to hear from other coaches they will be working under and hopefully bring that experience and that knowledge back to the group in May."||Despite having only spent a few days with his new charges, concluding with a win over the local SKN Patriots side, Watson suggested he had already seen "massive improvements in the bowling and the batting".||"The gap's definitely got closer to where we want to be and we've got a good base," he said.||Watson arrives at a time of turmoil for Cricket Scotland with four members of its equality and anti-racism working group having resigned last month over what they saw as a lack of progress in tackling racism.||Asked about being appointed in such circumstances, he thought it was good that he was coming in with a "new set of eyes and ears" but stressed his focus was on leading the side to the qualifier in Zimbabwe followed by July's T20 World Cup Europe qualifier, which is being hosted in Edinburgh.||Watson's interim spell takes him through to the start of August and, asked what might happen afterwards, he replied: "Shall we cross that bridge when we come to it?"||He replaced Shane Burger, with whom he played domestic cricket in his homeland, and sees his role as building on "quite a bit of success" his compatriot enjoyed with the team, finishing top of the Cricket World Cup Division 2.||However, Watson said he has limited his conversations with Burger about individual players because, "I've probably tried to come in with a set of fresh eyes and ears" and where "there's no pre-judgement".||The BBC's coverage of every Scottish Premiership team is bigger and better than ever before.

Gambling and football 'a match made in hell'||Scottish clubs should follow the English Premier League in banning betting sponsorship from the front of matchday shirts, a Celtic fan with a gambling addiction has said.||Lifelong supporter Martin Paterson, 63, warned action is needed to tackle the "horrible" addiction. ||The Premier League ban will come into force by the end of the 2025-26 season.||The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) said there were no plans to follow suit.||It stated sponsorship was "a matter for each club" and described betting deals as "a significant source of income" for many teams. ||Three Scottish Premiership clubs have betting sponsors on the front of their shirt - Celtic with Dafabet, Rangers with 32Red and Unibet and Dundee United with QuinnCasino.||Mr Paterson, whose calls have been backed by former first minister Henry McLeish, said his addiction began with betting on football coupons. ||He stopped gambling in 2014 and has been campaigning against online and casino gambling since.||"Gambling addition destroys families and because it's not a substance or alcohol it's easier to hide," he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ||"It's just a horrible, horrible addiction."||Mr Paterson said: "I fear that money is more important [to the clubs] rather than health, because gambling is a mental health disorder.||"And on a moral basis professional athletes should not be used as billboards advertising products that aren't safe for everyone."||According to the latest statistics from the Scottish Public Health Observatory, about 0.4% of Scottish adults - 18,000 people - were classed as problem gamblers in 2021. A further 1.5%, about 68,000 adults, were likely to be at risk of moderate gambling problems.||And men were significantly more likely to be problem gamblers than women, 0.7% and 0.1% respectively. ||Mr Paterson said he wanted clubs to go even further than they had in England and expressed fears that betting firms would still be advertised on shirt sleeves and training kits. ||"They can do better than promote products that aren't safe," he said. ||"Tobacco said sport wouldn't survive without their sponsorship and the gambling industry are using the same mantra. Of course they would survive.||"But on a moral ground we shouldn't be promoting this stuff to kids and thinking it's alright. It's embedded in society enough."||Mr McLeish, who also played professional football, described the English Premier League move as a "small but significant step forward".||He told Good Morning Scotland: "I am disappointed at the SPFL's response because it seems to be not tenable to argue that it's a matter for the clubs when indeed, as an association, they look after the general interests of football. ||"I think we're in a position in Scotland where, forgive the pun, it's a match made in hell because quite frankly the SPFL is desperate for money and of course the gambling industry is desperate for advertising. ||"So it's not a good decision on the back of what has happened in England."||While acknowledging Scottish football teams are often cash-strapped, the former first minister argued tobacco, alcohol and gambling firms should have no place in Scottish football. ||"We dealt with tobacco, now we've got to deal with alcohol, now we've got to deal with gambling."||The Scottish government launched a consultation on restricting alcohol advertising and promotion last year. ||Mr McLeish called for a phasing out of gambling and alcohol sponsorship to allow the SPFL and clubs to find alternative sponsors. ||"I cannot believe that in Scotland and the United Kingdom there are not good sponsors willing to come in to the game if the game itself could be made more attractive to those particular sponsors."||Following the English Premier League's announcement on gambling sponsorship, an SPFL spokesperson said: "There are no plans for a league-wide proscription of such deals.||"For many SPFL clubs, sponsorship from gambling companies is a significant source of income which helps to support their business models and enables investment in many of the important community activities which clubs undertake."||The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents the industry, welcomed the SPFL's statement.||It said the "overwhelming majority" of the 22.5 million people in the UK who bet each month do so "safely and responsibly". ||The organisation added the "rate of problem gambling remains low by international standards at 0.3% of the UK's adult population - down from 0.4% the year previous".||Ex-FM calls for end to alcohol adverts in sport||Alcohol advertising ban 'grave' for Scots football||Four business units approved||Greenock Telegraph opinion leader column on trains axe||Port Glasgow High School pupils enjoy extra-curricular fair||Military called in for Corran Ferry replacement||Christopher Wilkins targeting home World Championships in Glasgow||Watch: Billy Connolly, vinyl and the story behind Love Musics famous Irn Bru bottle||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Premiership manager in spotlight: David Martindale||Clive Lindsay, BBC Sport Scotland||With two games to go before the Premiership splits in two for the final round of fixtures, Livingston manager David Martindale could be about to suffer a sense of deja vu.||Almost a year ago, his side were heading into the top six until Motherwell scored an equaliser in the final seconds of their final pre-split game.||This time, having targeted European football prior to a 3-1 win over Kilmarnock at the start of February that lifted Livingston to fourth place with a game in hand over the teams around them, Martindale's side have dropped to seventh after two lacklustre and damaging 3-0 defeats on the road.||Not long ago, Martindale was being touted for a lucrative move up the football ladder. Now, though, if Hibs win the Edinburgh derby, Livingston will have to improve on a run of one win in eight as they host St Johnstone in order to avoid another top-six disappointment.||The plus points for the West Lothian side are that they are at home, have won both meetings so far this season with Callum Davidson's side and the visitors from Perth themselves are without a win in five outings as they sit only five points clear of the relegation play-off place.||Read all the weekend's Premiership picks||Corach Rambler wins Grand National after protesters delay start||Premier League: Haaland double puts Man City three up||Women's FA Cup semi-final: Man Utd pull level against Brighton||Who is the greatest football pundit of all times?||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Whats gone wrong with our housing?||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Can they tell the nice guys from the money chasers?||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Have a thrilling movie night tonight!||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now||Pinstickers' guide to the Grand National||Runners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.||Gadirova takes gold in dramatic all-around final.

'We just focus on ourselves' - Gracia ignoring other results||Javi Gracia says he is not paying attention to the results of the teams around Leeds in the relegation scrap, despite the fact his side do not play until Monday.||The Whites are two points above the bottom three but wins for Everton and Nottingham Forest would see them drop to 18th before the game with Liverpool at Elland Road.||With eight games remaining, Gracia says the position they are currently in is not the most important aspect.||"It's important to be strong in this moment," he said. "But not because now we're at the bottom, one point or ahead or behind.||"We just try to be focused on ourselves and to compete in the best way.

Dame Mary Quant: Fashion designer dies aged 93||This video can not be played||Watch: What Mary Quant's miniskirts looked like in the 1960s||Model Twiggy Lawson has led the tributes to designer Dame Mary Quant, who has died aged 93.||The fashion legend passed away "peacefully at home in Surrey", her family announced on Thursday.||Dame Mary was credited with popularising the miniskirts that helped define the Swinging '60s.||Twiggy, who became a style icon during the era, said Dame Mary had "such an influence on young girls in the late 50s early 60s".||"She revolutionised fashion and was a brilliant female entrepreneur," she wrote in a social media post. "The 1960s would have never been the same without her."||Former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman called Dame Mary a "leader of fashion but also in female entrepreneurship", adding she was "a visionary who was much more than a great haircut." ||Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director of the International New York Times, tweeted: "RIP Mary Quant, who freed the female leg. We owe you."||Her family described her as "one of the most internationally recognised fashion designers of the 20th Century and an outstanding innovator". ||"She opened her first shop Bazaar in the King's Road in 1955 and her far-sighted and creative talents quickly established a unique contribution to British fashion."||Dame Mary has been lauded for decades as an innovator whose chic designs melded comfort and practicality.||She drew inspiration from the counterculture scene that sprung up in west London in the 1950s, the area which became her base.||Taking cues from Mod style - which incorporated Italian sports clothing - she designed outfits that made women feel comfortable, rather than just items for big occasions. ||It appealed widely to a generation of young women eager for an alternative to the otherwise subdued fashions commonplace in post-war Britain. ||The Victoria & Albert Museum said: "It's impossible to overstate Quant's contribution to fashion. She represented the joyful freedom of 1960s fashion, and provided a new role model for young women. ||"Fashion today owes so much to her trailblazing vision."||Photographer David Bailey, who captured much of the spirit of London in the 1960s, told the BBC that Quant "was kind of wonderful, she was very positive".||Dame Mary was one of the most influential figures in the fashion scene of the 1960s and is credited with making fashion accessible to the masses with her sleek, streamlined and vibrant designs.||Born in south-east London on 11 February 1930, Dame Mary was the daughter of two Welsh schoolteachers.||She gained a diploma in the 1950s in art education at Goldsmiths College, where she met her husband Alexander Plunket Greene, who later helped establish her brand.||A budding designer, Dame Mary was taken on as an apprentice to a milliner before making her own clothes, and in 1955 opened Bazaar, a boutique on the King's Road in Chelsea. ||The shop would become the beating heart of Swinging London. Bazaar sold clothes and accessories and its basement restaurant became a meeting point for young people and artists. ||The whole Chelsea district was soon attracting celebrities such as Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.||Her far-sighted and creative talents quickly established a unique contribution to British fashion.||Dame Mary was arguably best known for conceiving the miniskirt and hot pants as well as helping to develop the mod style in the 1960s.||In 2014, Dame Mary, who named the skirt after her favourite make of car, recalled its "feeling of freedom and liberation".||She said: "It was the girls on King's Road who invented the mini. I was making clothes which would let you run and dance and we would make them the length the customer wanted.||"I wore them very short and the customers would say, 'shorter, shorter'."||Dame Mary told the Guardian in 1967 that "good taste is death, vulgarity is life", and raised the hemline well above the knee as she created short dresses and skirts with simple shapes and strong colours that she described as "arrogant, aggressive and sexy".||Whether or not Dame Mary actually invented the miniskirt has been the subject of a long and bitter dispute with late French designer Andre Courreges, among others.||But her role in turning the thigh-skimming super-short hemlines into an international trend has not been disputed.||Dame Mary explored geometric designs, polka dots and contrasting colours, and played with new fabrics, including PVC and stretch fabrics, to achieve a modern and playful look.||Her models were showcased in extravagant and provocative window displays overlooking the King's Road, which became a miniskirt catwalk and drew American photographers keen to picture Swinging London.||Writing in her 1966 book Quant by Quant, Dame Mary recalled: "City gents in bowler hats beat on our shop window with their umbrellas shouting 'immoral!' and 'disgusting!' at the sight of our miniskirts over the tights, but customers poured in to buy," she recalled. ||As well as popularising the bob haircut pioneered by her friend Vidal Sassoon, the hairstylist and businessman, Dame Mary also created hot pants, the skinny rib sweater and waterproof mascara.||Dame Mary, who was also a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal, the society's highest award, was made an OBE in 1966 and a dame in 2015 for services to the fashion industry. She was made a companion of honour in the most recent New Year Honours.||A retrospective exhibition of her work opened at the V&A in 2019 and has since toured Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan. ||Reflecting on the first 20 years of her career as the show launched, Dame Mary said: "It was wonderfully exciting and despite the frenetic, hard work we had enormous fun.||"We didn't necessarily realise that what we were creating was pioneering, we were simply too busy relishing all the opportunities and embracing the results before rushing on to the next challenge."||Actress and designer Sadie Frost said she was "honoured" to front a documentary about Dame Mary's "astonishing life" in 2021.||"The more I researched and delved into her life I realised the vast impact she had on fashion, popular culture, history and women's rights," Frost said in a statement to the BBC. "I really felt like I knew and loved her.

Selles on injuries, survival prospects and Palace||Southampton manager Ruben Selles has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League home game against Crystal Palace.||Here are the main headlines from his news conference:||Selles does not expect any of his injured players to return, including striker Che Adams, although full-back Tino Livramento is likely to feature for the Saints' B team on Friday as he builds up his match fitness.||He remains confident that the Premier League's bottom club can escape relegation: "We have shown how competitive we can be, we're still alive, we'll try to get three points on Saturday and then move forward to the last part of the season with attitude and commitment."||On whether Saturday's fixture is a "must-win" game: "It's a clich of course but every game is a must-win. We need to put in a good performance to get the three points."||Selles believes Crystal Palace are playing a more direct style under Roy Hodgson than they did under Patrick Vieira, and Hodgson has been "clever in his approach". ||Sign up for Southampton notifications||Corach Rambler wins Grand National after protesters delay start||Premier League: Haaland double puts Man City three up||Women's FA Cup semi-final: Man Utd pull level against Brighton||Who is the greatest football pundit of all times?||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Whats gone wrong with our housing?||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Can they tell the nice guys from the money chasers?||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Have a thrilling movie night tonight!||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now||Pinstickers' guide to the Grand National||Runners, riders, trainers and form - all the key details you need to know for Saturday's big race at Aintree.||Gadirova takes gold in dramatic all-around final.

Newspaper headlines: King proud of Harry and nurses' strike reaction||The Daily Telegraph warns that nurses will embark on what it calls "the most extreme strikes yet", including "targeting" A&E departments. The paper believes there are "bitter divisions" between the unions, after health workers in Unison accepted the offer - and it says it's likely they will be asked to cover the shifts of striking colleagues in an effort to "mitigate dangers".||The Guardian says that in a major blow to ministers, union leaders and health service bosses, nurses are set to launch a "new wave" of strikes across England later this month. The paper suggests that walkouts could go on until Christmas. Likewise, the Times reports that Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members are preparing a campaign of strikes through the winter. The paper also says that - with no end in sight to the junior doctors' dispute - the RCN vote raises the prospect of nurses and doctors walking out at the same time. ||The Daily Mail warns of "fears of chaos, if doctors and nurses strike together". It says the NHS is braced for "a summer of mayhem" after nurses in the RCN rejected the latest 5% offer and one-off bonus payment. The "i" says the planned May bank holiday walkout is a major blow for Rishi Sunak in the run-up to local elections. It quotes sources saying there is "little chance" of a new deal. Online, the Independent reports that the escalation in the nurses' pay dispute amounts to the first all-out strike in NHS history, with "no exemptions for emergency care". "Just how much more can NHS patients take?" it asks.||The Daily Mirror leads on what it calls the "Coronation crackdown". It reports that the biggest security operation in a generation will be mounted at the event next month. It says there are concerns of attacks by "terrorists, eco-warriors and anarchists". ||The Daily Express highlights what it describes as the King's "conciliatory note", during a visit to Sandhurst yesterday, where he attended his first passing-out parade since becoming monarch. The King spoke of his "immense pride" in both his sons, recalling having watched Prince William and Prince Harry graduating from the military academy. "Despite it all! The King is proud of Harry," reads the paper's headline.||The FT Weekend carries the first public comments of CBI president Brian McBride since the sacking of the organisation's director general, Tony Danker. Mr McBride apologises after allegations of misconduct that have rocked the CBI. He rejects suggestions that the business group's "time has passed", but acknowledges change is required. Mr McBride tells the FT the CBI "has to be sharper" and "more focused" to reclaim the confidence of members and the government. ||"Hurrah", says the Daily Star in its editorial - "the great Grand National is finally upon us". The Daily Mirror wishes readers having a flutter "good luck". According to the Sun, there's another reason to make the heart beat a little faster. Rachael Blackmore - the first female National winner - is up against her boyfriend, Brian Hayes. The paper reckons Rachael - who is the bookies' favourite - will "rein supreme" in what it calls "the odds couple" stakes. ||Daily Express||Daily Mail||Daily Mirror||Daily Star||Daily Telegraph||Financial Times||Guardian||Independent||Metro||Morning Star||Sun||Times||The i|| 2023 BBC.

County Championship: Lancashire's bid to build a big lead at Essex thwarted by rain||Keaton Jennings held together Lancashire's second innings with a patient half-century on a truncated day's cricket against Essex at Chelmsford.||The Lancashire captain batted throughout the 36 overs possible before rain returned at tea leading to a premature end of the day.||By that time Jennings, the leading County Championship run-scorer last season, had racked up 80 runs from 170 balls and shared in an unbeaten fifth-wicket stand of 56 with 20-year-old wicketkeeper George Bell (30 not out).||When play was finally called off at 16:45 BST, Lancashire were 167-4 with a lead of 155 going into the final day.||Heavy overnight rain had left puddles in the outfield and the umpires required two morning inspections before deciding play could resume after an early lunch.||There was an immediate surprise as Jamie Porter and Sam Cook switched from their more familiar bowling ends. Porter quickly acquainted himself with the River End, though, and with the fourth ball of the day had Josh Bohannon playing down the wrong line and losing his off-stump.||The change did not inconvenience Cook either and in his third over he found the edge of Steven Croft's bat with Dan Lawrence taking a smart diving catch to his right at third slip||Dane Vilas showed attacking intent with a straight drive, a flick off the legs and a hook for boundaries before he miscued a massive heave and skied Doug Bracewell to mid-on to depart for 13 and leave Lancashire on 111-4.||After losing three wickets inside six overs, Jennings and Bell bedded down into preservation-mode partnership that was enlivened by a perfectly-timed straight drive off Porter by Jennings and a rare boundary off Simon Harmer through the covers from Bell.||Essex had an injury scare when Cook limped off mid-over as a precaution after landing awkwardly on his left ankle. They were already reduced to fielding Michael Pepper as replacement wicketkeeper after Adam Rossington damaged his hand.||Match report supplied by the ECB Reporters' Network.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

New waste and recycling facility approved for Cornwall||A new facility to deal with Cornwall's waste and recycling has been approved by a council committee.||The strategic planning committee unanimously agreed to grant planning permission for a new facility at Hallenbeagle.||The building will be able to process up to 140,000 tonnes of waste, including food waste and recyclable materials.||The council confirmed the new service would be operating across Cornwall by 2025.||Councillors also requested operators to place solar panels on the roof of the new building, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reported.||It said the facility was needed to ensure the council could roll out its new waste collection service, which would see rubbish collection change from weekly to fortnightly in late 2023.||The council said its processed food waste would be transported out of Cornwall and to a facility in Devon at the beginning of its operations.||Cabinet member responsible for waste services Carol Mould said the council would "ideally" have an anaerobic digester facility in Cornwall.||The applicants in charge of creating the new facility said it would be ready to process the expected rise in recycling as well as the food waste collected from homes.||Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Cyclone Ilsa: Powerful storm hits Western Australia||A powerful cyclone has hit Western Australia as a category five storm, setting a wind speed record but sparing populated areas from major damage.||Severe Tropical Cyclone Ilsa struck the state close to Port Hedland, the world's largest iron ore export hub, just before midnight (17:00 BST). ||The storm has beendowngraded to category two, but alerts remain in place for some inland communities.||The cyclone is the strongest to hit the region in some 14 years.||Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecaster Todd Smith said a late south-easterly shift in the storm's path meant that "Port Hedland dodged a bullet last night".||Port Hedland Mayor Peter Carter described the sound of the wind hitting the town as "very eerie and unusual" and "like a freight train".||Officials said the storm was now tracking east, and warned inland communities to stay vigilant.||"There are several remote communities and mining operations which are yet to be impacted," WA's Acting Emergency Services Minister Sue Ellery told reporters.||One well-known local tavern and caravan park lying right in the path of the storm - the Pardoo roadhouse - suffered "great damage", its owners said on Facebook.||But there have so far been no reports of injuries to people and all critical infrastructure was undamaged by the cyclone, the region's fire chief said. ||"Once we can get crews onto the ground and helicopters in the air... we will move along the coast just to check to see roads and other critical infrastructure," Peter Sutton told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).||Winds of 135.5 miles per hour (218km/h) were recorded on Bedout Island just off the coast as the storm touched down, setting a preliminary 10-minute sustained wind record for Australia.||The previous record was 120.5mph (194km/h) - winds that were recorded when Cyclone George slammed into the country in 2007.||As Ilsa's very destructive winds move inland, the storm is predicted to weaken further overnight into Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said. ||As the cyclone approached, Port Hedland residents made last minute preparations by sandbagging and securing homes and businesses, Channel Nine reporter Ezra Holt told the BBC from the town.||He added that there were mixed emotions within the town, with some not too fussed, and others more concerned because cyclones this strong are quite rare. ||Ships, including iron ore carriers, were reportedly moved from the Port Hedland harbour as the storm approached.||The last category five cyclone to hit WA was Cyclone Laurence in 2009. Two years earlier, another category five storm, Cyclone George, killed three people as it tore through mining camps just south of Port Hedland.||US airman, 21, charged over Pentagon documents leak||Jack Teixeira's charges in full and what they tell us||Sudan leader insists army has control of key sites||'I am watching Notre-Dame being reborn'||Meet the hacker armies on Ukraine's cyber front line||Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise||Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on||India and Pakistans moment at Coachella 2023||Why you are 'probably' living in a matrix-like simulation.

Residents across the West claim potholes are damaging their vehicles||Residents and mechanics have claimed worsening potholes on their streets have been damaging vehicles.||People in the West of England have said the issue is getting worse and councils are not doing enough to fix them.||One Wiltshire resident said his car's suspension had been damaged and another said part of her wheelchair had become unusable because of the potholes.||Wiltshire Council said it now has received an extra 3.6m from the government to tackle the problem.||A council spokesperson said there had been an increase in the number of potholes across the country, "not just in Wiltshire". ||"We undertake regular monitoring of the network, as well as reactive repairs, and we would advise anyone concerned to report highway defects and potholes to us," they said.||Mr Hughes said the potholes on the nearby A365 look like they have reappeared after previous attempts to repair them.||"It's just like riding over very rough country roads and the council seems not reluctant, but unable to fix them," he said.||"It's fine in the daylight, but when it's been raining or in the darkness, you can't avoid them."||South Bristol resident Hari Clough, who uses a wheelchair with a hand bike attachment to travel longer distances, said the potholes had damaged it "rendering it unusable".||"The progressive potholes have damaged the mechanism that allows this to connect to my wheelchair," she said.||"I've had to pay 500 to get it repaired. In the meantime, I have to pay for additional taxi fares and I have to take a lot more time to do things."||Vanraj Jethwa, who owns AJ's Garage in Bristol, said he has been dealing with increasing numbers of vehicles from all over the west with suspension problems and blames it on potholes.||"It's very dangerous," he said.||"The percentage of suspension failures that we see have gone up. It tells you the potholes are causing a lot of problems."||Asphalt Industry Alliance Director Malcolm Simms, said the "crux" of the issue is authorities are underfunded.||"You need something like 14bn across the country and in our region (south-west) 1.5m alone," he said.||"The report that we issued this year shows it is by far the worst we've experienced for decades."||Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Jersey Walk into Light returns for first time since 2019||A fundraising event for a homeless charity in Jersey is back after being hit by several years of cancellations and postponements.||Walk into Light was one of Sanctuary Trust's main annual fundraisers, but was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. ||Resourcing issues last year also meant the charity was unable to hold the event.||This year it returns with walkers due to set off from 04:00 BST on Sunday.||Wearing high-vis vests and carrying battery-operated candles, walkers began walking in darkness, aiming to reach the finish line as dawn breaks at about 6:00 BST.||In 2019, Walk into Light attracted more than 300 walkers and raised 10,000 for the charity.||Sanctuary Trust chair Frank Walker said the aim of the walk was to highlight the "difficult path" its residents take.||He said: "We have really missed this event; not just because it is such an important source of annual funding for us but because it is a feel-good community event that anyone can take part in and show their support for Sanctuary Trust. ||"The significance of the walk is to highlight the difficult path that our residents make from the darkness and despair of homelessness into the light of leading a positive and independent life, once we have helped them back on track."||Follow BBC Jersey on Twitter and Facebook.

Spinal injuries: Paralysed motorcyclist learns to walk again||A motorcyclist paralysed in a crash and told he would never walk again has taken his first steps with robotic legs originally developed for US soldiers.||But Harold Price, 79, is paying 800 a month to be treated privately after being denied help on the NHS.||His story is "very common" because physiotherapy services have been "left behind", a rehabilitation expert has said. ||A health board said patients were free to choose non-NHS therapies. ||It was on 11 June 2021 that Harold's life changed forever when he broke his neck in a crash 12 miles (19km) from his home in Griffithstown, Torfaen. ||Recalling the fateful day, the retired fitter said: "I was going to go cycling and my [motorcycling] mate rang me up.||"But for five minutes and this wouldn't have happened." ||After bumping into the back of his friend's bike at about 15mph (24km/h), Harold came off his 500cc Honda Rebel, and was rushed to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ||Despite undergoing emergency spinal surgery, his hands and legs were left paralysed. ||"They thought I wouldn't walk again," he said. ||"I was really devastated. I thought 'I have got to get on my feet'."||Rehabilitation from a spinal injury often involves many hours of physiotherapy.||But Harold's clinical status - not able to walk again - disqualified him for physiotherapy on the NHS.||So he sat at home trying to teach himself to walk using a homemade device. ||It led to a couple of falls and a lot of worry for Harold's wife. ||"I turned my back and he was on the floor," remembered Sybil, 77.||"There didn't seem to be much hope.||"But having lived with Harold for 50-odd years, I knew he wasn't going to give up and he kept saying in the meetings, 'I'm going to walk'."||Sybil remembered being "very frustrated" because Harold was making progress even without physiotherapy, but his local GP was sticking with the original prognosis. ||"They sent me a letter saying 'we can't do anything', they said 'he's not going to walk'," she said. ||"There was nowhere to go, so we had to decide then we're either going to listen to them and Hal will sit in a wheelchair, or we are going to pay ourselves." ||She found a private clinic specialising in spinal injury rehabilitation in Langstone, Newport.||"When they said on the national health he couldn't have any more physio, I found this place," Sybil said from the Morrello Clinic where Harold does an hour-long session twice a week.||"We really haven't looked back since."||Harold recently took his first steps since the accident using a walking frame with clinical specialist Sam Miggins crawling along the floor beside him "placing" his feet. ||He called Ms Miggins his "life saver".||The progress has come after Harold's determination during sessions at the Morrello Clinic meant he was selected for a trial with wearable robotic legs. ||Keeogo was developed by Canadian company to increase the strength and endurance of US soldiers.||"The technology can help to pick up your feet," said Morrello's clinical director Jakko Brouwers, explaining how sensors in the robotic legs respond to the patient's movements.||It means Harold can walk from one end of the clinic to the other, getting the repetitions needed to learn to walk again. ||"If you can only get fifty steps in a day that's fifty opportunities to learn," Mr Brouwers explained. ||"With wearable robotics we can increase the amount of repetition."||Sessions with the robotic legs have also helped his mental health, making him think he has got "a bit of a chance" to walk again.||But it comes at a financial cost. ||Harold pools his 350 monthly disability allowance from the Department for Work and Pensions with 450 of his own money to pay for eight hours of physiotherapy a month.||"We're not rich, but we can afford to prioritise the money that we've got for Harold," said Sybil. ||Mr Brouwers said the NHS has to prioritise acute services over rehabilitation, adding: "There isn't really the emphasis on buying technology to enhance the rehabilitation experience that people are getting."||"People should not be paying so much for access to equipment," he added. ||Mr Brouwers sees a "common thread" of people who deteriorate physically and mentally when they are sent home from hospital.||"It is very important to keep the positive mindset after catastrophic injury and the outlook is bleak," he said.||Professor Diane Playford, a consultant in neurology and in rehabilitation medicine at University of Warwick, said it is "very common" to find patients in Harold's situation. ||"Unfortunately, although the acute services have been developed, the rehabilitation services haven't and they've been left behind," she said. ||But better rehabilitation would ultimately mean less pressure on acute services, Prof Playford added.||A spokesperson for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: "Most patients who are admitted to our specialist spinal rehabilitation centre at University Hospital Llandough are in the first phase of their rehabilitation journey.  ||"All outcomes and prognosis are made following individualised specialist multi-disciplinary assessments and patient outcomes vary, depending on level and complexity of spinal injury. ||"We do not place a time scale on progress or limits on rehabilitation.||"On discharge, rehabilitation continues within the community and local health boards and professionals undertake further assessments regarding the therapy input required to support ongoing rehabilitation.   ||"All patients have the right to decide what is the best action for them, and this may be through non-NHS services." ||A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We recognise the importance rehabilitation can have on a person's recovery which is why we are providing health boards with an additional 1.4m per year for community-based multi professional rehabilitation support workers, as well as 5m annually to fund more allied health professionals, which include physiotherapists, to provide rehabilitation services and support people to recover." ||TV presenter shows life

Lukas Skinner: World champion young surfer welcomed home||Surfer Lukas Skinner has been given a hero's welcome home after winning a major international competition.||The 15-year-old, from Perranporth, Cornwall, beat competitors from around the world to win the World Grom Search Finals in Australia.||Lukas said being the first British surfer to hold the title was "special" and a "surreal" experience.||It means he follows in the footsteps of world champions Gabriel Medina and Stephanie Gilmore.||Lukas said the win was seen as the traditional "start of every world champs career".||"It was so good to go to Australia for the first time and just experience new things, it was so surreal, I was surfing with the best surfers in the world and to be around them, it was the best thing I could ask for," he said.||Lukas was also crowned the U16 champion at the Rip Curl Grom Search European Final 2023 in Morocco in February.||Lukas started surfing at the age of three with his dad Ben Skinner - an 11 times European longboarding champion.||Mr Skinner said: "We're just so proud of him, he's just achieving everything that he puts his mind to, got some big dreams and goals and just keeps going all the way.||"I think 2028 is a huge possibility for Lukas to make it to the Olympics, I think this is proof of what he's just achieved."||Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

County Championship: Sam Cook takes five as Essex bowl out Lancashire cheaply||James Anderson warmed up for this summer's Ashes by claiming the prized scalp of former England captain Alastair Cook in his first County Championship appearance for 11 months.||Lancashire's decision to bat first on a straw-coloured wicket meant Anderson remained tucked up in the pavilion until required to bat shortly before tea. ||England's all-time leading wicket-taker then required just three balls in Essex's reply to collect his first wicket of the domestic season.||Nick Browne chased one that lifted outside off-stump to give a catch to Luke Wells at first slip before Cook played forward half-cock in his sixth over to be judged lbw.||Anderson finished the day with 2-33 from 11 overs as Essex reached the close on 98-3, in response to Lancashire being bowled out for 207.||Sam Cook, the more than promising Essex seamer with aspirations of eventually replacing Anderson when he retires from Test cricket, took the limelight with his first five-wicket haul of the season.||Lancashire's up-and-down innings was underpinned by 20-year-old wicketkeeper George Bell, having only his fourth Championship outing, who was ninth out for a career-best 60 from 109 balls that included 10 fours and displayed maturity beyond his years.||Not that there were too many signs early on of the sort of life that Anderson was to extract in his seven-over salvo in the evening session. ||When Tom Westley misjudged a ball from Will Williams to become another lbw victim, Essex were 25-3, but England batter Dan Lawrence (39) and Matt Critchley (23) saw Essex to stumps with an unbroken half-century partnership.||That included five penalty runs when Grandhomme's return to the wicketkeeper hit Critchley's bat and was penalised under Law 28.2 for "illegal fielding of the ball".||Match report supplied by the ECB Reporters' Network.||These comments are now closed.||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss the art of punditry and rank the best analysts||Panorama investigates the problems Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy policy is causing 40 years on||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||Check out the star-studded selection of films to watch on BBC iPlayer now|| ||Great Britain's Jessica Gadirova takes gold in a dramatic women's all-around final at the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antalya.||Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will "not put a number on" how many world titles he can win as his bid for an eighth Crucible crown gets under way against Pang Junxu on Saturday.||Novak Djokovic argues with the match umpire over what turns out to be a wrong line call during his Monte Carlo Masters defeat by Italian Lorenzo Musetti.|| || || ||After Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus calls the bidding situation for Manchester United a "farce", BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at where the sale of the club stands.|| || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

Canoe club's plea to stop sewage gushing into River Trent||A canoe club has called on Severn Trent to do more to stop raw sewage pouring into a river where they train.||Sewage has entered the River Trent after heavy rainfall and forced the Stafford and Stone Canoe Club to cancel competitions and training. ||The club has produced Olympians who said they had seen toilet paper floating in the water.||The water company said it is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to reduce overflows in the region.||Among those reporting "horrendous smells" and used toilet paper floating in the water were Olympians Adam Burgess and Joe Clarke MBE.||"When it overflows it smells horrendous and I dread to think what would happen if someone swallows that water," Mr Burgess said.||"I have memories of seeing sewage and toilet paper coming into the water course. There's a massive health and safety risk to those using the river," Mr Clarke added.||In October last year, the Staffordshire-based group hosted a national competition but had to send rowers and spectators home after sewage gushed into the water and along the ground.||Severn Trent has said it understands the canoe club's concerns and is working to fix the problem. Phil Gooding, the club's chairman says the filters that have been installed on the sewage pipe "are not fit for purpose and don't catch anything."||Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Married Somerset couple to renew vows as two women||A couple who married as husband and wife are planning to renew their vows as two women.||Jae and Rayna Harvey, who live in Somerset, married in Jae's hometown of Dallas, Texas in 2018, but at the time Rayna was struggling with her identity.||Rayna 35, came out as transgender to her wife on their honeymoon, a few months later.||"I didn't feel like I was present at our first wedding. I wasn't marrying you as myself," she told her wife.||Jae, 32, added: "It was maybe a month or two after we got married, she sat me down and said 'I'm having all these thoughts and feelings and I'm not really sure what it means'."||Once they reached their honeymoon destination, a Center Parcs in the UK, the newly-married couple  together made the decision that Rayna would try presenting as a woman. ||"I was like, well this is the perfect opportunity because we're not going to know anybody there," said Jae.||Rayna added: "I think I just ended up in a very, very safe space with you and that gave me the confidence to trust in you with what was going on in my head."||So, during their stay, the couple went to dinner with Rayna dressed in women's clothing. ||"She brought a dress with her and I did her hair and makeup," Jae added.||"The waiter comes up and says 'good evening ladies' and I look across the table and the look on her face said it all, she didn't even need to come out to me at that point. ||"I knew in that moment that this is it for her."||Jae said she had always been attracted to both men and women and just wanted to support her partner.||"In Ray's coming out, I've realised that it doesn't matter where you fall on the spectrum, it's the person that I fall in love with."||The couple explained that since Rayna came out, their relationship had changed for the better.||"We just don't have this weird, sort of grey divide between us any more," said Rayna.||Jae added: "We can talk about anything with each other (now)."||Jae and Rayna now plan to renew their vows as two brides in front of friends and family.||"I think there was feelings there before, but I wasn't marrying you as myself," Rayna said to Jae.||"Just experiencing it as who I actually am. That would be great," she added.||"I think it's only fair that she gets her bridal experience," added Jae.||Rayna started to post her transition journey on social media, initially to track her progress. ||Now the couple want to continue using their online platform to provide a voice for others and inspire people to be confident in who they are.||"You can be who you want to be and there will be people that will love and care for you, no matter who you are," said Rayna.||Jae added: "If you're faced with people who don't agree, you can always find the people who do and will support you, and we try to be those people for anybody who finds us on social media.||"We try to be positive and encouraging and uplifting because it can be scary."||Rayna added: "I am very, very privileged that I've managed to find my way through my transition the way that I have and I want to use that to help other people."||The couple have not yet set the date to renew their vows but said it would be black and white themed, to symbolise death and rebirth.||Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Anthony Gordon: Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has 'no issue' with winger's angry reaction to being substituted||Newcastle boss Eddie Howe says he has "no issue" with winger Anthony Gordon after his reaction to being substituted in last Saturday's win at Brentford.||Howe replaced Jacob Murphy with Gordon at half-time before bringing the 22-year-old off deep into stoppage time.||Gordon reacted angrily and Howe confirmed they had since "had a conversation" about the incident.||"We want to embrace that, we love that about him, but in certain moments he needs a cool head as well," Howe added.||"It's about trying to explain the situation, talk through it. I've got no issue with him at all. He's trained really well this week.||"His enthusiasm, aggression and motivation levels are really, really high. He's fiercely determined to do well and achieve. It is one of his hallmarks, it's one of his strengths."||Asked if Gordon, who has made one start since his 45m move from Everton in January, felt the need to apologise, Howe said: "Yes, I think he did. He accepted he was overly emotional.||"Part of me understood why he acted like he did. I didn't condone it - you don't want to see any player react like that because, suddenly, you will have a team that looks like it doesn't have the discipline that it needs.||"I made a decision based on Anthony going down holding his ankle, based on the fact there were seconds left on the clock, to try to do what I felt I needed to do to win the game.||"He needed to accept that and, if he had an issue, come and see me in private. That's how I felt he should have reacted in that situation.||"But it's a young player learning about the game and learning about us at the same time.||"He has so much talent and ability, but he needs help to get to where his career should go. Fingers crossed, we can work on that together."||The victory at Brentford followed up wins over West Ham and Manchester United during the previous week and kept Newcastle third in the Premier League, above Manchester United on goal difference.||They both have nine games remaining and asked whether his side, who visit Aston Villa on Saturday at 12:30 BST, can qualify for the Champions League, Howe said: "I think there's a growing belief that we're getting back to our best form after a difficult period around January time, where we were a little bit frustrated with ourselves in the Premier League.||"I think I've said the Wolves win [in March] was a big, big moment for us, it got us back to winning ways.||"We've backed that up with three really tough games over the last week. That was a big test for us mentally and physically, we came through it.||"Now we go into what I see as the last set of games this season, but a big test to come.
