RSS Feed (Really Simple Syndication)||In a world heaving under the weight of billions of web pages, keeping up to date with the information you want can be a drag.||Wouldn't it be better to have the latest news and features delivered directly to you, rather than clicking from site to site?||Using RSS (Really Simple Syndication) allows you to see when sites from all over the internet have added new content. You can get the latest headlines and articles (or even audio files, photographs or video) in one place, as soon as they are published, without having to remember to visit each site every day.||RSS takes the hassle out of staying up-to-date, by showing you the very latest information that you are interested in.||RSS feeds are just a special kind of web page, designed to be read by computers rather than people. It might help to think of them as the free, internet version of the old-fashioned ticker-tape news wire machines.||Not all websites currently provide RSS and not all sections of the BBC or BBC Sport website are available as feeds.||In general, the first thing you need is something called a news reader. ||This is a piece of software that checks RSS feeds and lets you read any new articles that have been added to them.

Browser-based news readers let you catch up with your RSS feed subscriptions from any computer, whereas downloadable applications let you store them on your main computer, in the same way that you either download your e-mail using Outlook, or keep it on a web-based service like Hotmail.||Once you have chosen a news reader, all you have to do is to decide what content you want to receive in your news reader, by finding and subscribing to the relevant RSS feeds. For example, if you would like the latest BBC Sport Cricket stories, simply visit the Cricket section and you will notice an orange RSS button.||Most modern browsers, including Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari and Chrome, automatically check for RSS feeds for you when you visit a website, and display the orange RSS icon when they find one.

Mauricio Pochettino: Chelsea in talks with ex-Tottenham boss to become new manager||Chelsea are in advanced talks to make former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino their new manager.||The Argentine, whose most recent job was at Paris St-Germain, is keen on the role but more negotiations will take place before any deal is finalised.||Chelsea want a quick resolution and believe they are at the end of the process as they search for a permanent replacement for Graham Potter.||Pochettino, 51, would take over from interim manager Frank Lampard.||The former England midfielder took charge of the Blues after they sacked Potter at the start of April, but has lost all four of his games in charge.||It is not yet known whether Pochettino, who has been out of work since PSG sacked him in July 2022, will take over immediately or whether Lampard will stay on as planned until the end of the season.||The Argentine said no to an initial approach from Chelsea, but now the club are happy to hand him more control as he looks for a job that allows him to have input and impact beyond selecting the first team.||Chelsea held talks with former Bayern Munich boss Julian Naglesmann before he fell out of the running.||Former Spain and Barcelona manager Luis Enrique had been among the contenders, and Burnley boss Vincent Kompany, who has guided the Turf Moor side to promotion to the Premier League this season, was also on the shortlist.||Pochettino managed Spurs for five years from 2014 and led them to the 2019 Champions League final, which they lost to Liverpool.||He was sacked in November 2019 after they made a disappointing start to the following campaign - they were 14th in the Premier League at the time of his departure.||Pochettino also guided Spurs to the League Cup final in 2015 and second in the Premier League in 2016-17, with Chelsea winning both competitions.||He was also the Tottenham manager during an infamous game against Chelsea in May 2016 in which his side picked up nine yellow cards, and the hosts three.||Spurs took a 2-0 lead at Stamford Bridge, but were held to a 2-2 draw - a result that ended their title hopes and confirmed Leicester City as Premier League champions.||Pochettino had been linked with a return to Tottenham after Antonio Conte left in March, but instead looks set to join their London rivals.||New York Times journalist Rory Smith, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's The Monday Night Club: "Pochettino would be a great appointment for Chelsea. If I was Pochettino I would also have several pressing questions about what Chelsea's vision is and taking it with a sense of trepidation.||"I would ask [co-owner] Todd Boehly what he was thinking by signing all these players and what was his plan. Depending on his answer I'd have a vague idea if I was being set up for success or not.||"Pochettino makes perfect sense and I think he is unfairly remembered for not winning anything at Spurs - that completely misses the point of what he did there.||"He's the strongest candidate and he's what Chelsea need - playing progressive football and developing young players."||Former Chelsea forward Chris Sutton on The Monday Night Club: "I think it would make sense for Chelsea to go for Mauricio Pochettino. The one question I'd be asking Boehly, if I was Pochettino, would be if he is staying out of the dressing room. ||"Pochettino would want control and would not want that. Boehly has been too hands-on and if Pochettino goes in he wants it is his way. Chelsea is an attractive proposition."||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65381067
NFL: Aaron Rodgers to join New York Jets after trade deal agreed with Green Bay Packers||Aaron Rodgers - the NFL's four-time Most Valuable Player - will join the New York Jets after they agreed a trade deal with the Green Bay Packers.||The quarterback said in March that he intended to end his 18-year spell with the Packers and join the Jets.||Rodgers, 39, had spent his entire NFL career with Green Bay, helping them win the Super Bowl in 2011.||"I know this, he will always be a Packer," said the team's general manager Brian Gutekunst.||"I have so much respect for Aaron and the person he is. He has done so much for this organisation."||As well as Rodgers, Green Bay will be giving the Jets a fifth-round pick in this year's NFL draft, which begins on Thursday.||The teams have also agreed to swap places in the first round of the draft, with Packers now having the 13th overall pick and the Jets 15th.||In addition, the Jets will give the Packers their picks in the second and sixth rounds, plus a second-round pick in the 2024 draft that could become a first-round pick if Rodgers plays 65% of the Jets' plays this coming season.||"He'll be missed," added Gutekunst. "Players like that don't come around very often. He'll be one of the best who has ever done it around here.||"But we are very excited about where we are going.

Cristian Stellini sacked by Tottenham: What is going on at Spurs?||Tottenham's worst Premier League defeat since 2013 has triggered more anger among fans about the state of their club.||Chairman Daniel Levy is getting the brunt of the blame; the humiliation of Tottenham being 5-0 down against Newcastle after just 21 minutes seen as the culmination of a string of disastrous decisions dating back to the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino in November 2019 - less than six months after Spurs had played in the Champions League final.||Levy called Sunday's result "wholly unacceptable", sacked interim boss Cristian Stellini and put Ryan Mason back in charge for the final six games of the season.||It is a big call. ||Theoretically, Tottenham - in fifth - still have a chance of finishing in a Champions League place, though few expect that to become a reality. And Aston Villa, Liverpool and Brighton are snapping at their heels in the battle for European qualification.||After this weekend's FA Cup semi-finals, seventh place will earn a Europa Conference League place, with fifth and sixth going into the Europa League. The last time Tottenham fans had no European football to look forward to was 2009-10.||So, what happens now?||The major issue is who now provides Levy with football expertise to assist in the decision-making process.||Remarkably, Tottenham are without a manager for either their men's or women's team.||Stellini lasted four games. On 27 March, Levy said it was time for everyone to "pull together". By 24 April, the message had changed to "the squad is determined to pull together". Who is doing the pulling? Not Fabio Paritici, who resigned as managing director of football last week after he lost his appeal against his worldwide football ban - imposed after Juventus, where he was sporting director and managing director, were found guilty of false accounting.||Paritici's 30-month ban was initially imposed by the Italian authorities in January. It was not extended worldwide by Fifa until March, though that outcome was always likely.||Yet Tottenham claimed Paritici's change of status came completely out of the blue and they had no knowledge it was going to happen.||It was made worse by the fact that 24 hours previously, the Italian had been put forward as the public face of the club. Speaking extensively to their own website about Conte's exit, he declared Tottenham were "focused and looking forward" to the remainder of the campaign.||It is understood there has been no contact from Tottenham with Pochettino, who would be welcomed back with open arms by the majority of supporters.||Levy's best managerial appointments - Martin Jol, Harry Redknapp and Pochettino - have been somewhat under the radar. The stellar names - Jose Mourinho and Conte being the two most recent examples - have not gone well.||In the aftermath of Mourinho's dismissal, less than a week before Tottenham lost to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, Levy spoke about returning to the club's "DNA".||That, presumably, centres around free-flowing, attacking football that delivers excitement. The two managerial appointments since then are Conte and, before that, Nuno Espirito Santo - the former Wolves boss who was chosen after a protracted search during which candidates were considered and discarded, in Gennaro Gattuso's case, after not enough due diligence had been done on his background.||The names being mentioned now include Julian Nagelsmann - recently sacked by Bayern Munich and who has pulled out of the running to replace Graham Potter at Chelsea - and Luis Enrique, who left the Spain job after last year's World Cup and has not managed at club level since 2017.||There is also Brendan Rodgers, who left Leicester earlier this month after an awful season, and Potter, who some think was out of his depth at Chelsea. Others view the former Brighton boss as failing at an impossible job. Potter's replacement at the Amex, Roberto de Zerbi, also has his admirers.||Eleven months ago, Tottenham's owners agreed a 150m "capital increase" for the club.||That was viewed as a pot of money that Conte could use to turn a squad that had just sneaked into the Champions League into contenders.||Money was spent, yes, but few would argue it has been spent wisely. Brazilian forward Richarlison was signed for 60m but has failed to consistently perform at the highest level, while 25m midfielder Yves Bissouma impressed at Brighton but has been inconsistent for Spurs. Argentina defender Cristian Romero has been better but his impetuosity is a liability at times. ||There are numerous players in the Tottenham squad that are not up to the standard the club demand but how many could attract the transfer fee to fund a squad rebuilding programme?||Son Heung-min's contract runs to 2025 but the South Korean's form this season has been very poor by his usual high standards. He even said he felt "responsible" for Conte's departure "because I haven't helped the club all that much".||And that, inevitably, brings us to Harry Kane.||The England skipper is about to enter the final year of his present deal. Numerous clubs, including Manchester United, would be interested if Levy finally relented and let the 29-year-old leave.||But, given the negativity that already exists around the club, is that something Levy could even contemplate?||The problems at Tottenham are easy to identify. Finding solutions is far more difficult.||Anna Howells,Spurs XYexternal-link||I am lost for words. Well, I am lost for positive words. I do not think there was anything good that came out of the weekend.||Clearly this is not a team any more. There is no leadership - not from the players, not from the coaching staff, not from the operational side.||Harry Kane is the only one who can hold his head up high, but that is down to his incredible character and the commitment and determination he has for his profession.||I think most fans would agree we do not deserve him and would not blame him for leaving in the summer.||It is baffling to me how the owners cannot see the mess they have created over the past five to 10 years by not investing correctly into the footballing side of the club.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65375207
Cristian Stellini: Tottenham sack interim manager after Newcastle thrashing||Interim manager Cristian Stellini has been sacked by Tottenham Hotspur after four matches in charge.||The decision comes a day after Spurs were thrashed 6-1 at Newcastle - a performance chairman Daniel Levy has described as "wholly unacceptable".||Stellini, 48, was appointed on 26 March after Antonio Conte's 16-month spell as Spurs boss came to an end.||Ryan Mason, who worked under Stellini and took charge when Jose Mourinho was sacked in 2021, succeeds him.||Sunday's defeat at Newcastle, where they trailed 5-0 after 21 minutes, was a significant blow to Spurs' hopes of securing Champions League qualification.||"It was devastating to see," added Levy.||"We can look at many reasons why it happened and while myself, the board, the coaches and players must all take collective responsibility, ultimately the responsibility is mine."||Tottenham are fifth in the Premier League table, six points behind both Newcastle in third and Manchester United in fourth.||Both teams have played fewer games than Spurs, who host Erik ten Hag's side on Thursday.||Spurs won one, drew one and lost two games after appointing Stellini, who acted as Conte's assistant during his time as manager.||Stellini also led the side when Conte was missing from the touchline after a gall bladder operation in February, with Spurs winning three of their four Premier League games in Conte's absence, but also losing to Championship side Sheffield United in the FA Cup.||"Cristian stepped in at a difficult point in our season and I want to thank him for the professional manner in which he and his coaching staff have conducted themselves during such a challenging time," said Levy.||Former Spurs and England midfielder Mason, 31, returns to the helm for the final six games of the season.||"Ryan knows the club and the players well," added Levy.||Stellini apologised for the defeat at Newcastle, saying the performance was "unexpected".||He changed the system to a back four for the first time this season but returned to three centre-backs after 23 minutes when he substituted midfielder Pape Sarr with Davinson Sanchez.||The thrashing was Spurs' heaviest Premier League defeat since December 2013, when they lost 5-0 to Liverpool at White Hart Lane.||"It went so badly because we were not prepared enough to play an important match," Stellini told Sky Sports.||"We have a good squad but today no-one showed how good we are. It was my responsibility to decide how we play and we decided to do it differently because of the injuries. It is my responsibility, I took it and it was wrong.||"I have to take responsibility because once we changed system we played better, scored and showed fight. It's very difficult to understand why the first 25 minutes were so bad."||Stellini's tactical decisions had drawn the ire of Spurs fans during his brief tenure, particularly when Sanchez was brought on as a substitute in the 35th minute during the 3-2 defeat against Bournemouth and then booed when he was taken off in the 58th minute.||Spurs are searching for their fourth permanent manager in four years since Mauricio Pochettino left in 2019.||Questions over the playing style have persisted under Stellini, with Spurs conceding nine goals across their last two league matches, the most they've conceded in consecutive league games since May 2003.||Ramon Vega, former Spurs defender on BBC Radio 5 Live ||"Issues have been accumulating for weeks, months and years.||"It sums up this club for the past 10 years. The recruitment side is a shambles and the players are not playing like they are supposed to play - you can see that the dressing room is completely split, there's no spirit in this side whatsoever."||On Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy:||"If you are the owner, you are accountable for what happens within the club. You need to make sure all the tools are being given to the management for the football side.||"But the problem is that the whole recruitment has been a shambles for years, from the top to the bottom all the way to the academy and they've wasted a lot of money in that time.||"I think the fans are fed up. They don't see football any more, they don't see excitement, they are not winning anything for a long time.||"And I think Levy needs to take accountability. He made mistakes because he made decisions. He doesn't leave many decisions to the football people and he doesn't recruit the right people."||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65365163
Champions League: Uefa must change revenue distribution, says Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish||European football's governing body Uefa must change how it hands out Champions League money, says Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish.||Parish says Uefa's coefficient ranking system has helped Europe's elite clubs become "entitled with winning". ||He feels that has also contributed to a "two-speed Premier League".||"There's a top half and a bottom half, and that disparity will get bigger and bigger unless we put some rules in to try to control it," Parish added.||The Palace chairman was speaking at the launch of the Union of European Clubs (UEC) in Brussels on Monday.||The UEC's general secretary, Dennis Gudasic, says that of the 22bn euros (19.5bn) in revenue earned by Uefa from club competitions over the past 25 years, 34% of it has been distributed to a group of just 12 clubs.||Currently 30% of Champions League revenue handed out to the 32 clubs in the group stage is determined by their coefficient ranking, which based on how that club has performed in Europe over the past decade. Clubs who have played in Europe regularly over that period get more of that 30% than those who have not.||While Parish accepts the value of the Premier League's television broadcast deals means the distortion caused by European earnings is less stark in England than in other leagues, he believes Europe's top clubs have an unfair financial advantage.||"We've got six, now probably seven, teams [in England] where the amount of capital they have is either unlimited or is enormous compared to us, and qualifying for European football is almost impossible," he said.||"It still doesn't feel like a meritocracy entirely. And with the coefficient, it feels more and more that there's a two-speed Premier League.||"You're up against the situation where people have become so entitled with winning that they don't accept any system which challenges the status quo or threatens it, and I think that's what we have really got to look at across Europe."||The UEC is an organisation which seeks to give a voice to more than 1,000 professional clubs in Europe.||Representatives from 103 clubs were present for the UEC launch in person or online, with Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton and Watford the other English clubs represented.||The UEC believes there are around 1,400 professional clubs in Europe who do not have a voice and should be represented on Uefa decision-making boards in the same way that member clubs of the European Club Association (ECA) are.||The UEC says only 130 clubs have voting rights within the ECA.||Parish also said Uefa's position as a regulator and commercial operator "seems a massive conflict of interest".||"I do believe there needs to be bigger separation of 'church and state', if you like," he said. "The people organising the tournaments and the people regulating them, and taxing those tournaments for the greater good, should be two different people."||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65380806

Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty says he has 'self-destructive' tendencies||Britain's three-time Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty says he has been in a "self-destructive spiral" but hopes he is coming out the other side.||The 28-year-old pulled out of the British Championships earlier this month citing mental health issues.||He was not included in the Great Britain squad for July's World Aquatics Championships.||"I've been on a self-destructive spiral, which I don't mind saying because I'm human," he told the Times. external-link||"I got to a point in my career where I didn't feel like myself. I didn't feel happy swimming and I didn't feel happy racing, my biggest love in the sport.||"I've had my hand hovering over a self-destruct button because if I don't get the result that I want, I self-destruct."||Peaty, who still intends to compete at next year's Olympic Games in Paris, has previously spoken about periods of depression and problems with alcohol, which he says worsened last year as he struggled with injury, motivation and the breakdown of his relationship with the mother of his young son.||He was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).||He added: "It's been an incredibly lonely journey. The devil on my shoulder [says], 'You're missing out on life, you're not good enough, you need a drink, you can't have what you want, you can't be happy'.||"Some days you feel good and you don't have to talk back; some days you feel horrendous, so you have to talk back and get through it."||Peaty has dominated his breaststroke events for nearly a decade, successfully defending his 100m title at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 having earlier that year set a record for the fastest 20 times in history over the distance.||Over his career, he has also won eight World Championship gold medals, 17 golds at European Championships and four golds at the Commonwealth Games. ||But he missed out on gold in the 100m event in Birmingham last year, finishing fourth behind James Wilby after sustaining a broken foot in the build-up.||Although his world record is nearly a full second quicker than anyone else has ever swum, he says that chasing that perfection is taking its toll.||"Any sane person knows that 18 years doing the same thing is pretty much crazy," he said. "Trying to find tiny margins year after year, trying to find 0.1%.||"The dedication and sacrifice - weekends and all your time are spent chasing that goal for this one opportunity of Olympic glory.

Indian Premier League: Delhi Capitals hold on to beat Sunrisers Hyderabad in exciting finale||Delhi Capitals beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven runs in a low-scoring thriller to claim back-to-back wins in the Indian Premier League.||Chasing 145, Sunrisers needed 13 from the final over but Mukesh Kumar bowled well to restrict them to 137-6.||Delhi, who lost their first five games in this year's IPL, earlier scraped to 144-9 after two batting collapses.||Both teams have won just two of their seven games but Capitals remain bottom of the table on net run-rate. ||Capitals were 1-1 in the first over as England's Phil Salt was caught behind for a duck.||Delhi captain David Warner made 21 off 20 balls against his former side before becoming the first of Washington Sundar's three wickets in five balls in the eighth over, which saw the visitors fall from 57-3 to 62-5.||Manish Pandey and Axar Patel both hit 34 as they shared the highest partnership of the match, worth 69 off 59, but Delhi collapsed once again, losing four wickets for eight runs in 12 balls late on.||In reply, England batter Harry Brook managed just seven off 14 balls before being bowled by Anrich Nortje.||Mayank Agarwal looked to have put Sunrisers on course for victory as he hit 49 off 39 balls before he was caught off Axar, who also removed Hyderabad captain Aiden Markram.||Nortje claimed his second wicket when he had South Africa team-mate Heinrich Klaasen caught for 31 off 19 in the penultimate over with the game in the balance.||Sundar then could not find the boundary off Mukesh, who conceded only five from the last over, despite Delhi having to bring an extra fielder inside the circle after failing to bowl their overs in time.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

Premier League predictions: Chris Sutton on Man City v Arsenal title showdown & other midweek games||Leaders Arsenal and champions Manchester City meet in a title showdown on Wednesday, but who will come out on top?||"After going three games without victory, Arsenal can approach this as if the pressure is off," said BBC Sport's football expert Chris Sutton.||"But that run of draws was so damaging, and you can see that doubt has kicked in. If the Gunners can win, it would be an incredible turnaround after what has happened to them in recent weeks."||Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League matches this season, against a variety of guests.||Some of his attempts at guessing the correct scorelines have been frighteningly bad - so it is appropriate that this time he is up against two specialists in horror - Evil Dead Rise writer and director Lee Cronin and Living With Chucky writer and director Kyra Gardner.||Evil Dead Rise is the fifth film in the classic Evil Dead franchise, and was released in UK cinemas on 21 April. It is currently number two in the global box office.||Living With Chucky is a documentary exploring the impact of the Chucky films - Kyra's father, Tony, was the special effects expert who brought the iconic killer doll to life in the famous Child's Play movie series. It came out on digital download in the UK on 24 April.||How does Sutton think he would fare if he ever met Chucky? "I have worked with Robbie Savage," he explained. "So Chucky doesn't scare me."||Gardner grew up in the United States as a keen junior footballer and had to choose between a soccer scholarship and majoring in film at college.||She told BBC Sport: "I don't keep up with much in the professional world now, but I did play soccer, forever.||"I started when I was about three. My mum got me into it - she had never played it herself, but she wanted us to play. Then I played club soccer from the age of seven all the way to 17.||"I played centre-midfield and had the opportunity to take it further and perhaps maybe make a career out of it, but I couldn't because of film school. They wouldn't let you be on a sports scholarship while being on an arts programme at the same time.||"I miss it it a lot, because soccer was my whole world for such a long time. Now it is like I have this skill that I don't use any more - but I will make a comeback eventually!||"Women's soccer is such a big sport in the United States so I am not surprised it has become so popular in the UK too, but it has taken a while.||"I lived in London for a few months a few years ago and although everyone would talk about soccer all the time, I never heard anyone mention women's soccer games.||"It's great to hear that is changing and it has taken off in a big way, as it should - but just remember who the world champions are when the World Cup comes along this summer!"||Cronin has supported Liverpool since he was a young boy in Ireland, and remembers the exact moment he chose the Reds.||"Really specifically, I have been a Liverpool fan since August 1990 when I was eight years old," he told BBC Sport. "That came off the back of me waking up to football when the Republic of Ireland played at Italia 90.||"I spoke to my cousin, who was a little bit older than me, about who I should support and he had a copy of Shoot! magazine where the centre pull-out was squad photos of Liverpool on one side, and Manchester United on the other.||"I took one look at United and said 'no way' and became a Liverpool fan.||"I definitely made the right choice but in hindsight it wasn't the best time to start following then, three months after they had become champions in 1990. I had to wait a very long time to see them do it again and I spent the next few years being surrounded by United fans at school, which wasn't much fun at all.||"I remember going to watch Liverpool play a couple of pre-season friendlies in Ireland and it was the era of players like Istvan Kozma so it wasn't exactly a glamour team.||"Things did get better though and the standout player for me in the years that followed was always Robbie Fowler. His finishing was just something special. He was the player that, when you were a kid and you went down your local field, you would try to finish like he did.||"I remember when he came back a few years later and had that swansong with Liverpool at the end of his career - that was probably the most excited I have ever been by a Liverpool signing, even though he was long past the peak of his powers by then."||A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.||Crystal Palace are still unbeaten under Roy Hodgson but they didn't really carry a goal threat in Saturday's draw with Everton.||From Roy's point of view, the job he was brought in for was to make sure Palace stayed up and it is as good as done. They are not mathematically safe but they are nine points clear of the relegation zone with six games to play so I think they have got enough points in the bag already.||Wolves still need another win, or maybe two, but they are hardly on the edge either. ||The obvious result to go for here is 1-1, because I can't see there being loads of goals and both sides would probably be delighted with a draw. ||Chris Sutton's prediction: 1-1||Kyra's prediction: 1-2||Lee's prediction: There are goals in this game but they might cancel each other out. 2-2||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||Aston Villa got away with it a bit at the weekend. I tipped them to beat Brentford but they did not really get going against the Bees and were lucky to get a draw.||Just when it appeared that Fulham's players had signed off for their summer holidays, they have now won back-to-back games - deservedly so each time - and look really committed.||It will be close but Villa are at home and have been in good form under Unai Emery so I still fancy them to sneak this one.||Chris Sutton's prediction: 2-1||Kyra's prediction: 2-0||Lee's prediction: Villa are on a great run. 2-1||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||I keep tipping Leeds to pick up points at home and to be fair I have only been about 10 goals out.

For no reason whatsoever I am going to say a home win for Leeds.

The way some of them have conducted themselves this season makes me wonder if they really care - the Blues are five points behind Brentford in the table for a reason.||The Bees were good against Villa at the weekend after a little spell where their results had just fallen away and we know how well organised they always are.||Chris Sutton's prediction: 1-1||Kyra's prediction: 0-1||Lee's prediction: This will be pretty dull. 1-1||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||West Ham have had a great week with two four-goal wins, in the Europa Conference League and then at Bournemouth, but their improvement goes back further than that.||The Hammers have taken 10 points from their past four games and they are at the stage where another win will probably be enough to keep them up.||I am not sure they will get it here, despite the improvement of Michail Antonio. This season, like a lot of West Ham players, he has been a bit of a disappointment, but things have really clicked for him of late.||They will make life difficult for Liverpool and while I think Jurgen Klopp's side will score goals, I still don't trust the Reds defensively - Nottingham Forest caused them problems so West Ham will too.||Chris Sutton's prediction: 2-2||Kyra's prediction: 0-2||Lee's prediction: This is the big event of the night and the game everyone is talking about. I am still really cautious about our form, but I am going to back us here. 1-2||Lee on Liverpool's season: My favourite player now has got to be Mohamed Salah because I love a goalscorer, but I was a huge fan of Georginio Wijnaldum and think we have really been missing his consistency in midfield. People go on about the effect of Sadio Mane leaving but for me Wijnaldum was the engine of the team and he was the bigger loss. ||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||I am very confident with my prediction for this game - the only thing I wasn't sure about was whether Arsenal would score.||The Gunners are playing this match at one of the worst possible moments because City have found their rhythm and are hitting some incredible form.||I really hope Arsenal are brave and take the game to City because the Gunners' attack is their strength, but in many ways that will play into the home side's hands.||Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus - on his return to Etihad Stadium - will all carry a threat, but we have seen how vulnerable they are at the back in the past few weeks, and how on earth do you stop Erling Haaland and co?||If, say, Nathan Ake is out injured then that will hamper City a bit, but I still see Pep Guardiola's side really dominating the game, and they are absolutely relentless when they come forward.||Chris Sutton's prediction: 3-1||Kyra's prediction: So the title is on the line in this game? I have to go with Arsenal here because they are the team I know the best. 2-3||Lee's prediction: Being a Liverpool fan, I know what it is like going toe-to-toe with City. I think Arsenal have had an amazing season but I think their energy has started to drop, while City have really started to hit top form. 3-1||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||Everton reminded me of Sean Dyche's old Burnley side when I watched them against Crystal Palace at the weekend.||Dominic Calvert-Lewin came into the team and they were very direct, with balls into him and then trying to find runners off that.||They were also hoping for Alex Iwobi and Demarai Grey to spark something with some individual brilliance but it didn't really happen, and you could really see why the Toffees are the lowest scorers in the Premier League this season.||This is the last game they need after dropping into the bottom three. Everton don't carry enough of a threat and then you are left asking whether they can keep an in-form Newcastle side out. ||I don't think they can, and being at home won't make any difference, because the Magpies will frighten the life out of them.||Chris Sutton's prediction: 0-2||Kyra's prediction: 0-3||Lee's prediction: This is more out of hope than expectation. I am still thinking about Liverpool making the top four and although Newcastle have just had a big win, there is still a bit of inconsistency in their team and they are our best hope of sneaking in there, more so than Manchester United. It's a heck of a long-shot though. 1-1||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||Bournemouth could effectively relegate Southampton here. ||Saints would not be mathematically down, of course, but they will still be feeling sick after dropping points so late on against Arsenal and a defeat would be a huge blow to them. ||Will that happen, though? On paper, yes. Southampton's home form has been wretched while Bournemouth had been doing pretty well until they ran into West Ham at the weekend.||I am going against the grain, though. This is very difficult to call but I just have a feeling Saints will get something here. They won't keep a clean sheet, though.||Chris Sutton's prediction: 2-1||Kyra's prediction: 0-1||Lee's prediction: I changed my mind on this one - my thinking now is that display at Arsenal will give Southampton a bit of a bounce. 2-1||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||I really fancy Manchester United here. Tottenham just capitulated against Newcastle and they are in such a mess that they have just fired their interim manager, Cristian Stellini.||If Newcastle had continued scoring at the same rate they did in the first 21 minutes, then they would have ended up winning 22-0.||Will Spurs bounce back, after one of the most gutless displays I have ever seen? I am not convinced.||United were fortunate to get through their FA Cup semi-final with Brighton. I enjoyed the game and how it panned out, and Erik ten Hag's side were quite effective on the break. ||I don't see them scoring as many as Newcastle did, but I definitely don't think Tottenham will keep a clean sheet. ||I am sure Spurs won't be as bad as they were on Sunday, but I just can't back them at the moment.||Chris Sutton's prediction: 1-3||Kyra's prediction: 2-1||Lee's prediction: This is the one that sticks in my throat because I don't want to be honest, but I think United will win. 1-2||To enjoy Newsround at its best you will need to have JavaScript turned on.||Chris Sutton, Kyra Gardner and Lee Cronin were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.||From last weekend's Premier League fixtures, Sutton got four correct results from eight matches, including one exact score, giving him a total of 70 points.||With two games still to be played, he is leading Enter Shikari bassist & QPR fan Chris Batten, who got three correct results with one exact score, giving him a total of 60 points.||Only 12% of you thought Southampton would avoid defeat at Arsenal but you were correct about wins for Fulham, Liverpool and Newcastle.||*Win, draw, loss prediction based on highest % of vote for each match.||Get latest scores and headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65329288
World Snooker Championship 2023 results: Mark Selby beats Gary Wilson to set up quarter-final against John Higgins||Mark Selby beat Gary Wilson 13-7 to set up an intriguing World Championship quarter-final against fellow four-time champion John Higgins.||Selby went in to Monday's concluding session with a 10-6 lead over his fellow Englishman and knocked in a superb 109 break to move further clear. ||Wilson took the next frame with runs of 58 and 53 before Selby sealed his win. ||His match against Scotland's Higgins, which starts Tuesday afternoon, is a repeat of the 2007 and 2017 finals.||"The biggest thing for me at the moment is when I'm being asked the question I am standing up out there," said Selby. ||"That wasn't happening for six to 12 months so I am pleased with that especially here because you can easily collapse."||A four-frame deficit was always likely to prove difficult for Wilson to overhaul against a player who has repeatedly demonstrated his superb temperament and durability at the Crucible. ||While he was far from his best here, Selby has shown he knows how to peak for the business end of this tournament and has already showcased his return to form this season with success at the English Open and WST Classic after battling mental health issues. .||Meanwhile, Anthony McGill will play Chinese debutant Si Jiahui in the other last-eight match to begin on Tuesday afternoon after completing a 13-8 win over Jack Lisowski. ||England's Lisowski reeled off seven frames out of eight as he fought back from 10-1 down to trail 11-8 on Monday evening. ||And with Scotland's McGill suddenly appearing nervy it prompted talk of the Crucible's biggest ever comeback. ||However, the 2020 semi-finalist edged closer to victory with a timely run of 48, before coming from behind in the 21st frame to clinch victory on the colours with a break of 58.||"Even when it's going wrong there's an enjoyment to it in a way. You are not going to go best of 19, 25 or 33 just flying with everything going in," McGill added.||"Si gave an incredible performance against Shaun [Murphy], who is the player of the year, and he then goes and beats an experienced head like Rob Milkins."||McGill, who has now reached three world quarter-finals in four years, has lost all three matches he has played against Si.||Higgins, who thrashed Kyren Wilson 13-2 with a session to spare in the second round, won the 2007 final 18-13, with Selby triumphing 18-15 a decade later. ||The pair, who are staying in adjacent hotel rooms in Sheffield, have met on two other occasions at the Crucible, each winning once in what has become one of snooker's greatest rivalries.||"I need to play close to my best to get through," added Selby.||"The way John played against Kyren was phenomenal. It wasn't even as though Kyren really did anything wrong. You know if you are not playing near to your best you are going to be on the losing side so at least you know what you have to do." ||Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news on the BBC app.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/snooker/65381193
Sri Lanka v Ireland: Andrew Balbirnie's 95 helps tourists post 319-4 on day one||Ireland battled back from last week's first Test hammering by Sri Lanka to impressively reach 319-4 by the close on day one of the second Test in Galle.||Skipper Andrew Balbirnie was denied a first Test century as he was dismissed for 95 after his record Irish Test partnership of 115 with Paul Stirling.||The partnership had been halted with Ireland 204-3 as Stirling was 74 not out when he retired hurt with cramp.||But Lorcan Tucker's unbeaten 78 rounded off a tremendous day for Ireland.||It was a gritty response from the tourists after Sri Lanka's biggest ever victory last week, as they clinched an innings and 280-run win in Galle, with Ireland's run of Test defeats since earning full member status in 2017 increasing to five.||In the opening Test in Galle, Sri Lanka had taken immediate control by posting 591-6 in their first innings.||However, crucially, Balbirnie won the toss on Monday and while Ireland looked in trouble at 43-2 following the cheap departures of Peter Moor (5) and James McCollum (10), they regrouped superbly as the skipper produced a 46-run partnership with Harry Tector.||Tector's dismissal for 18 left Ireland on 89-3 but the big-hitting Stirling's arrival saw him take the game to the hosts as he struck three sixes and six fours, before having to go off after ending up sprawled on the ground when attempting to avoid a short ball from Asitha Fernando.||After Stirling's departure, Balbirnie's scoring rate continued to diminish and as Sri Lanka applied the pressure, the Ireland captain was dismissed when his attempted sweep shot off a Ramesh Mendis ball was instead nicked to Dhananjaya de Silva at slip.||That left Ireland on 232-4 with Stirling also in the pavilion, but Tucker continued the brilliant form that saw him record his first Test century in Bangladesh earlier this month as he pushed Ireland beyond the 300-mark, with Curtis Camper also unbeaten on 27.||Tucker survived a strong bat-pad appeal as Mendis took a catch off a Prabath Jayasuriya delivery with home skipper Dimuth Karunaratne choosing not to review the decision.||Balbirnie played down his misfortune at missing out on joining Kevin O'Brien and Tucker as the only Ireland Test players to hit centuries.||"I would have loved to score a hundred but I am not disappointed as in I was able to put the team in a very good position," said the 32-year-old Dubliner.||"As a young Test playing nation, we are very pleased with what we have achieved today and we need to seize the moments from here on.||"It was a remarkable fightback by the boys after the first Test."||Ireland are optimistic that Stirling will be able to resume his innings on day two as they will look to reach a runs tally in excess of 500, with their previous highest Test total of 339 against Pakistan in 2018 almost certainly going to be beaten.||Stirling's inclusion in place of George Dockrell was one of three Ireland changes with left-arm   Matthew Humphreys handed a Test debut and Graham Hume also drafted in as Murray Commins and Mark Adair were left out.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

Chevron Championship: Lilia Vu's emotional maiden major win at Carlton Woods near Houston||It was a major that had everything bar crowds of a size commensurate with its prestige.||More people than the sparse galleries who turned up for the record $5.1m (4m) tournament should have witnessed Lilia Vu's maiden major victory last Sunday.||It came at the first hole of a sudden death play-off, capping a thrilling final day at the Chevron Championship. ||The competition had moved from its iconic venue at Mission Hills in California to Carlton Woods near Houston - the home of American big oil. It was a business decision.||Yet watching the golfing drama unfold - and there was plenty - put you in mind of the dark Covid days of behind closed door tournaments. ||There were galleries but not anywhere near the numbers to make the event have a big time feel, which is a crying shame because, otherwise, the Chevron had all the ingredients. The course was a proper major test and identified a worthy champion with a compelling back story.||Angel Yin, the golfer beaten in sudden death, also has an inspiring tale to tell, despite faltering on the closing stretch before birdieing the last to take it to extra holes.||Nelly Korda, the Olympic champion and stand out star on the final day, will bemoan squandering a fine chance to land a second major. But her failure showed this was a tournament where no one could fake it.||In the end it was Vu, who had shown trending form, who dissolved into tears of joy and relief at the biggest win of her career. This was a victory that her formative days suggested would be inevitable, but for so long seemed so far away.||The 25-year-old from California had even contemplated giving up the game when she struggled to transition into the paid ranks.  ||A former amateur world number one and eight times winner in her college days, Vu made just one cut in her rookie season of 2019, earning a mere $3,830 in the process.||Then her inspirational grandfather, who engineered her family's flee from the ravages of the Vietnam War, died at the beginning of the Covid outbreak. The prodigy tipped for greatness was at a complete loss.||"I was in such a bad place," Vu said. "Everything was life or death. I just saw everybody that I've competed with being successful, and I just compared myself all the time." ||But she stuck at it and has become a more rounded and mature golfer, slightly less prone to aggressively chasing every pin.  In February she won the LPGA tournament in Thailand, a week after finishing third in Saudi Arabia.||Three more top 14s followed in the lead up to the year's first major. Pundits regard her now as the second best American on the circuit behind Korda.||Yet, at Carlton Woods last week she still needed to battle her emotions. "Honestly, the past two days, I was very angry," she admitted.||"I didn't feel like myself, just internally. Golf game, that's whatever. I just felt like I was getting angry over every single little thing, and that's usually not how I roll, so I was upset about how I portrayed myself and how I handled myself."||In the chilly final round she equalled the lowest score of the day with a four-under 68 that included a mere 25 putts and was capped with two crucial closing birdies to post 10 under par.||England's Georgia Hall also shot 68 to finish in a share of 12th in another solid week for the Dorset player. She joined us on our BBC 5 Sports Extra radio commentary a good two hours before the end.||"Ten under will be the winning score," Hall accurately predicted, pointing to the difficulty of the inward half with tucked pins on undulating greens.||Yin looked as though she would pip that number, as did the Thai sensation Atthaya Thitikul, but both faltered. Yin dropped shots on the 16th and 17th, the latter followed an uncontrolled bunker shot after indecision on the par-three tee.||Thitikul found water at the last, running up a double-bogey seven. This feels as though it was the major the 20-year-old had to lose before she makes her breakthrough on the biggest stage - it is surely not far away.||Yin now looks more like the talent who made two Solheim Cup appearances very early in her career. She is till only 24, but a debilitating injury led to her slumping to 172 in the world.||Last summer her shoulder was so bad she could not even unscrew a bottle top. "The last two majors, (the AIG Women's Open) and Evian [Championship], I couldn't even move," Yin said.||"I got super injured out of nowhere, so that was really, like, a low point for me because I couldn't even get out of bed, and I tried to play still, and it was just impossible."||Now she is back and she was the personality of the weekend in Texas after the unexpected early exits of the likes of world number one Lydia Ko, defending champion Jennifer Kupcho, Lexi Thompson and Charley Hull.||"I did play well," the big-hitting Yin said. "I really like this golf course. ||"I feel like I have so much potential here, and I feel like it's exciting to come back next year and be able to showcase that and do what I didn't do this year."  ||The course won universal approval. "It is a proper major test with its length," Hall told us. "These are the courses we should be playing."||Maybe one day the crowds will show up too. This was crackerjack of a major, even if it ended in contrived fashion with the champion diving into the water in the way that winners at Mission Hills did with the sanitised 'Poppie's Pond'.||This time it was a murky, dark, cold lake. Vu had discussed with her caddie the prospect during a practice round. "I was like, 'Yeah, I would jump; if I won here, of course I would jump,'" Vu said.||"Yesterday or the day before we saw a snake in the 17 pond so I was kind of thinking about that today, but I think the emotions were high and just adrenaline said 'got to jump into that pond'."  ||We are entitled to predict great things for the new champion, however she may have to recover from pneumonia first!||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Analysis and opinion from the BBC's golf correspondent.||Get the latest golf headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.||From hitting a few balls on the range or a quick nine holes, to the full 18 and tournaments - how to get into golf.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/golf/65331714

England v France: Head coach Shaun Wane turns focus to 2025 World Cup||England head coach Shaun Wane says Saturday's mid-season Test match against France will be the official start of his side's next World Cup campaign. ||It's the first game for England since they lost in heart-breaking circumstances as host nation in last year's World Cup semi-finals, going down to a golden point extra-time defeat by Samoa.||But a new-look squad will aim to put that pain behind them when they take on France at Warrington's Halliwell Jones Stadium on Saturday. And Wane says the focus now is on the future and beginning preparations early.||"Everything is about the next World Cup in 2025," said Wane, who has agreed a new contract that will see him lead the side into that next tournament.||"I've picked a squad that I think can do a really good job, and they're at the right age that can fire, improve and get better in time so that they are peaking in 2025.||"I'm excited about how young the squad is. I'm hoping everybody else is. Some of the talent in Super League is really impressive.||"There are players who played in the last World Cup who were [aged] over 30, which is not normally how I pick my teams, but they were the best players.||"We need to get better as a game to make sure we've got more younger players coming through and that's what I've picked. And it's about feeding them information about what is international standard."||Warrington half-back George Williams will captain the side, taking over from Catalans' Sam Tomkins, who is due to retire at the end of this season. ||And Williams rates it as the greatest honour of a career that has seen him pick up winners medals in two Grand Finals and a World Club Challenge.||"It's the best ever," said Williams. "I don't think you can top that. I always looked on playing for England as the top, so this is probably beyond my wildest dreams."||But Williams remains frustrated at the lack of confirmed international fixtures in the run up to World Cup 2025, which will be staged in France.||A three-match series against Tonga has yet to be confirmed for the end of this year. And although there are plans for Samoa to tour Europe in 2024, that has yet to be signed off.||Wane says he would be happy to take his team to the Southern Hemisphere for a viable Test series, if no nations could be persuaded to travel north.||"Absolutely, we just need to play international games," he said.

Tadej Pogacar says he is 'lucky' to only break wrist in Liege-Bastogne-Liege crash||Two-time Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar has said he was "lucky" to only break a wrist when he crashed out of Sunday's Liege-Bastogne-Liege one-day classic.||Belgian Remco Evenepoel won the race to retain his title.||Pogacar, 24, had surgery on Sunday night and is now recovering.||"I'm lucky it's just a broken wrist, considering the crazy crash that happened," the Slovenian posted on social media.||"I really wish the best recovery to Dane Mikkel Honore who went down way harder than me.||"Congrats to Remco Evenepoel for the victory, our battle will wait until next time."||UAE Team Emirates said Pogacar's recovery would take about six weeks which will hamper his preparation for the Tour de France, which starts on 1 July.||Liege-Bastogne-Liege was to be the final race on Pogacar's programme before he set off for altitude training. ||Team medical director Dr Adrian Rotunno said Pogacar had sustained a "scaphoid fracture which required a small screw to realign the bone fragments. The procedure was successful and he will begin his recovery period at home".||"Due to the nature of the injury, it's approximately six weeks recovery. Though he will start with immediate rehab, and some training on an indoor trainer in the coming days," added Rotunno.||Honore - who crashed with Pogacar - also had to pull out of the race after 85 kilometres and was taken to hospital.||Pogacar had been aiming to become only the third man to complete a hat-trick of Ardennes classic wins, after Davide Rebellin in 2004 and Philippe Gilbert in 2011.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Road, track, BMX, mountain and many more - there are so many ways and reasons to start cycling.||Got a big cycling race coming up?

Premier League relegation: Which teams will drop into Championship?||How's your nerves?||The battle for Premier League survival continues to provide drama and unpredictability - but there are signs the relegation picture is finally becoming a bit clearer.||At the start of April, there were only four points separating Crystal Palace in 12th and bottom-of-the-table Southampton - the least amount of points between the teams 12th and 20th at that stage of the season in Premier League history.||Now, less than a month on, there have been big changes with Bournemouth, Wolves, Crystal Palace and West Ham making a strong dash for survival.||The gap now between 12th-placed Crystal Palace and bottom side Saints is 13 points, but there is still only five points between the bottom five. With six games to go, could we be looking at the three to go from that five? A group that includes Leeds, Leicester and Everton.||Before some crucial midweek matches, including Leeds v Leicester and Southampton v Bournemouth, data specialists Nielsen's Gracenote has studied the stats and judged each team's chances of being relegated based on their remaining fixtures, giving them a percentage chance of survival.||Gracenote says 39 points will be enough to guarantee Premier League survival, with more than a 90% chance of staying up with 36 points, but BBC Sport wants to know how you think the fight to avoid the drop will go. ||See what percentage chance the teams have of surviving relegation and give your thoughts with our ranked list.||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 0%||Crystal Palace had not won in the league in 2023, leading to the dismissal of manager Patrick Vieira with 75-year-old former Eagles boss Roy Hodgson given the task of keeping them in the division.||Hodgson has worked wonders, guiding the Eagles to 10 points in four games and near safety.||Still to play: 25 Apr Wolves (a), 29 Apr West Ham (h), 6 May Tottenham (a), 13 May Bournemouth (h), 20 May Fulham (a), 28 May Nottingham Forest (h)||Gracenote fact: Crystal Palace have the two most fouled players in this season's Premier League. Wilfried Zaha has been fouled on 71 occasions, one more than his team-mate Jordan Ayew (70).||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 0.4%||West Ham have finished sixth and seventh in the past two seasons but have found themselves fighting for their top-flight survival.||They have won three of their five league matches in April, losing only to Newcastle United. This has helped them to 1.5 points per match in their past 10, equalling Bournemouth as the best of the relegation candidates in the past 10 matches. ||Still to play: 26 Apr Liverpool (h), 29 Apr Crystal Palace (a), 3 May Manchester City (a), 7 May Manchester United (h), 14 May Brentford (a), 21 May Leeds (h), 28 May Leicester (a)||Gracenote fact: Seven of the Premier League's current top eight teams are the only clubs to have had more goal attempts this season than West Ham's 404. The Hammers are the least accurate of all Premier League clubs though, with only 29% of their attempts on target.||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 1%||Wolves are on their third manager of the season after Bruno Lage was sacked in October before a lengthy search for his full-time successor saw Steve Davis take charge for seven Premier League matches, with them only securing four points in that time.||Former Spain manager Julen Lopetegui has led them to seven league wins, including home victories over both Liverpool and Tottenham to take them out of the bottom three.||Still to play: 25 Apr Crystal Palace (h), 29 Apr Brighton (a), 6 May Aston Villa (h), 13 May Manchester United (a), 20 May Everton (h), 28 May Arsenal (a)||Gracenote fact: Wolves have scored the fewest goals of all teams in the Premier League from set-pieces this season. They have just six goals - two from penalties, two from free-kicks and two from corners. Brentford have scored the most goals from set-pieces with 23 in total. ||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 7%||Bournemouth were the first top-flight team to sack their manager this season with Scott Parker, who got them promotion last season, dismissed after criticising the club's summer recruitment following a Premier League record-equalling 9-0 loss at Liverpool in August.||Gary O'Neil has been their manager since, firstly on an interim basis before getting the job permanently in November and the Cherries did not win any of their first seven league matches following the World Cup.||Bournemouth's past last 10 matches though have produced five wins with four of those coming in the past seven fixtures. This is their best form of the season and has taken them from more than a 50% chance of relegation at the beginning of April to the brink of safety now.||Still to play: 27 Apr Southampton (a), 30 Apr Leeds (h), 6 May Chelsea (h), 13 May Crystal Palace (a), 20 May Manchester United (h), 28 May Everton (a)||Gracenote fact: Bournemouth have conceded 17 goals from corners in this season's Premier League, nearly twice as many as the next worst team at defending corners, Chelsea (nine). On average, Bournemouth concede a goal from every 13 corners they face.||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 41%||Jesse Marsch was sacked as manager in February with the club on a seven-game winless run but, after an encouraging start, things have got tough for new boss Javi Gracia.||Despite the home thrashings by Crystal Palace and Liverpool, Leeds United's past 10-match form is slightly better than their season as a whole. Their next two matches, against Leicester City and Bournemouth, will be key to their survival prospects. ||After those games, three of the last four matches for Leeds United are against teams in the top seven.||Still to play: 25 Apr Leicester (h), 30 Apr Bournemouth (a), 6 May Manchester City (a), 13 May Newcastle (h), 21 May West Ham (a), 28 May Tottenham (h)||Gracenote fact: Leeds United are the only one of the relegation candidates to have a player who is in the top-10 Premier League goalscorers this season. Rodrigo has scored 11 goals and is joint 10th on the top scorers list. The other 12 players with at least 11 goals this season all play for teams in the top half of the table.  ||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 33%||Leicester City came eighth last season and reached the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League, but made an awful start to this campaign as they only picked up one point in their first seven matches.||Manager Brendan Rodgers has been replaced by Dean Smith until the end of the season and he masterminded Saturday's victory against Wolves that ended a nine-match winless run and moved them out of the drop zone. ||They have taken just four points from their past 10 matches, the second-worst record of the relegation candidates, after Nottingham Forest. Leicester face Leeds United and Everton in their next two matches. Wins against both may be enough to save them. ||Still to play: 25 Apr Leeds (a), 1 May Everton (h), 8 May Fulham (a), 15 May Liverpool (h), 22 May Newcastle (a), 28 May West Ham (h)||Gracenote fact: Only the big six teams, plus Brighton, have attempted more passes this season than Leicester City.||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 51%||Everton's results had improved after Sean Dyche became manager at the end of January following the sacking of Frank Lampard - but not enough to steer them clear of trouble.||They beat Premier League leaders Arsenal in Dyche's first game as boss and have followed that with wins over Leeds and Brentford, as well as draws at Nottingham Forest and Chelsea.||However, the Toffees, who have played in the top flight of English football in every season since 1954-55, have hit a wall and have only picked up two points in the past four matches.||A repeat of Everton's point per match from their past 10 fixtures may be enough to keep them in the Premier League. Half of their remaining fixtures are against the bottom seven teams with the other three against teams currently in the top eight.||Still to play: 27 Apr Newcastle (h), 1 May Leicester (a), 8 May Brighton (a), 14 May Manchester City (h), 20 May Wolves (a), 28 May Bournemouth (h)||Gracenote fact: Everton have the lowest percentage of successful shots in the Premier League. They have scored from just 6.6% of their attempts, less than half the success rate of the best teams (Manchester City 15.7%, Arsenal 14.4% and Brentford 14.1%).||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 78%||Nottingham Forest are in their first Premier League season since 1998-99 after winning promotion from the Championship last season and Steve Cooper has signed 30 players in a bid to keep them at the top level.||They are the only team in the relegation battle without a win in their past 10 Premier League matches. Forest's last victory was a 1-0 win against Leeds United on 5 February. ||Four of Forest's remaining six matches are against teams in the Premier League's top-11. In 18 matches this season against these teams, Forest have taken just eight points from 54, winning just once (1-0 against Liverpool). ||Still to play: 26 Apr Brighton (h), 29 Apr Brentford (a), 8 May Southampton (h), 13 May Chelsea (a), 20 May Arsenal (h), 28 May Crystal Palace (a)||Gracenote fact: Nottingham Forest have used 33 different players in the Premier League this season, more than any other team.||Gracenote's chance of relegation: 89%||Southampton are another side on their third manager of the season after they sacked Ralph Hasenhuttl in November. He was replaced by Nathan Jones, but he only lasted eight Premier League matches and picked up one win before he was also dismissed.||Ruben Selles, assistant manager under Hasenhuttl, was next in line but they have now gone seven matches without a win.||Friday's draw at Arsenal was their only point in their past four matches and looks like being too little, too late. Four of Southampton's remaining six matches are against teams from the top half.||Still to play: 27 Apr Bournemouth (h), 30 Apr Newcastle (a), 8 May Nottingham Forest (a), 13 May Fulham (h), 21 May Brighton (a), 28 May Liverpool (h).||Gracenote fact: Southampton have kept fewer clean sheets this season than any other team in the Premier League.

Pakistan v New Zealand: Mark Chapman's century helps tourists draw T20 series||Mark Chapman's sublime unbeaten century helped New Zealand chase down 194 to beat Pakistan and draw their five-match T20 international series 2-2.||Chapman smashed 104 not out off 57 balls to record his maiden T20 international ton as the Black Caps won by six wickets in Rawalpindi.||It is New Zealand's second-highest successful chase in T20s, after they made 202-5 against Zimbabwe in 2012.||Chapman was supported superbly by Jimmy Neesham, who cracked 45 not out off 25.||The pair put on the highest fifth-wicket stand in men's T20 internationals, with an unbeaten 121 off just 58 balls.||Pakistan opener Mohammad Rizwan earlier fell just short of his second T20 international century as he finished on 98 not out off 62 balls.||Iftikhar Ahmed, who made 36 off 22, and Imad Wasim, who struck 31 off 14, helped propel the hosts to an imposing 193-5.||In reply, Kiwi captain Tom Latham fell first ball to Shaheen Afridi, who also removed Will Young with his fifth delivery to leave the visitors 4-2.||Chapman entered at 26-3 in the fourth over after Chad Bowes was bowled by Imad for 19.||He put on 47 off 37 with the more watchful Daryl Mitchell, who fell for 15 off 18, leaving New Zealand 73-4 off 10 overs, still needing 121.||From there, Chapman and Neesham cut loose, smacking 31 runs off the next two overs and then regularly finding the fence off Pakistan's quartet of pace bowlers. Chapman scurried two off Shaheen to bring up his ton in the 18th over.||New Zealand needed just three off the last over and Chapman hit the winning runs off Faheem Ashraf with four balls to spare.||Pakistan won the opening two games of the series, before New Zealand claimed a tight four-run win in the third and the fourth match was abandoned because of a hailstorm.||The two sides will now face each other in a five-match one-day international series.||This additional tour makes up for the tour that was abandoned in September 2021 because of a New Zealand government security alert.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?

Andy Preece: Chorley boss on being a black football manager reaching 750 games||Chorley manager Andy Preece arrives slightly late for our afternoon chat at Victory Park.||He has been planning the evening's training session and you don't get much spare time when you are in charge of a part-time National League North club. Even less when you are trying to guide them into the play-offs and there are only a couple of regular season games to go.||Results have not gone well for the Lancashire club in the days since we spoke, but they go into the final weekend a point off the top seven. A play-off spot would be a satisfying way to celebrate Preece's 750 games as a manager.||It is a journey he is proud of - following a playing career taking in Wrexham, Stockport County, Blackpool, Bury and a short spell in the Premier League with Crystal Palace. ||As a manager, there is less glamour to be found in places like Northwich and Chorley. He spent four years in the Welsh League at Airbus UK, where he earned the distinction of becoming the first black English manager to both qualify a team for European football and then take them into the competition.||But, Preece, 56, has stuck at it since he was appointed player-manager at Bury in the autumn of 1999, on the recommendation of Neil Warnock.||"People say 'do you feel lucky at getting the opportunity'," he says. "Why should I feel lucky? ||"I have managed for more than 750 games and have a 40% win ratio. I have been at clubs who have been struggling due to their financial situation. It is not luck. It is hard work and determination. I have taken jobs other people didn't want."||That tally of games is impressive. Even more so in an industry that statistics show simply does not afford black managers the opportunities given to their white counterparts.||At the start of the 1999-2000 season, there was one black Premier League manager, Ruud Gullit, who resigned as Newcastle boss in the August.||Patrick Vieira's exit at Crystal Palace in April means there are now no current black Premier League managers.||In the Football League - with struggling Reading sacking Paul Ince earlier this month - there is only Vincent Kompany at Burnley, Sheffield Wednesday's Darren Moore and Liam Rosenior at Hull City. ||"When I started out [at Bury] in 1999 I was one of five or six black managers," says Preece. "It is 2023 and I am probably one of less than five or six black managers. That is 24 years. Nothing seems to have changed.||"What has changed is that there are a lot more black players on the pitch; 43% of players are black and 40% have the Pro Licence [the coaching qualification]. But we are seeing 4% in managerial jobs. There is something still not right."||Preece is placing a lot of faith in the Black Footballers Partnership to challenge statistics and push for change.||Co-founded by former Derby and Jamaica player Michael Johnson, BFP commissioned two reports, in 2022 and 2023, that show no real improvement in management opportunities given to black candidates.||It says the Football Association's 'Football Leadership Diversity Code' paints a "partial and unusually rosy" picture of the present situation.||As someone who has spent a quarter of a century at the sharp end of management, Preece feels it is only through BFP that the true reality can be understood.||Ask Preece if his skin colour has been an impediment to his career, and he accepts that is the reality.||"There is no hiding from it," he says. "It is sad for me and, in 2023, it is ridiculous we are talking about things like this. But we have to. The data is backing it up.||"But I do feel there is a bit of hope now. We have to have a voice. If we don't talk about it and challenge things, they are not going to change."||Preece refuses to dwell on what opportunities he might have missed out on, stating simply: "My skin colour is not going to change. I am proud of who I am."||But he has been the victim of racism, which nearly led to his own 'Eric Cantona moment' towards the end of his playing days when he jumped into the crowd during a reserve game for Blackpool against Leicester to confront a supporter who had taken exception to the colour of his skin.||"It was constant and for the last 20 minutes I was just thinking about him and why he was abusing me," he says. ||"Something snapped at the end of the game. I ran and confronted him. There weren't many fans there so I could see him. When I got there, I thought 'what are you doing?'. The lad started windmilling. Fortunately we got pulled apart and nothing really happened. But it was a difficult moment."||Although Preece was charged by the FA, a number of eye witnesses provided evidence on his behalf, so he avoided a significant suspension.||"The Blackpool fans who wrote those letters, that was pretty special for me. That made me realise people will support you and if you feel that you need to speak out about something, don't be afraid to," Preece recalls.||In a separate incident as a manager, Preece asked the game to be stopped and for a fan to be removed for racially abusing him. When stewards moved the fan to another part of the ground, Preece stopped the game again until the supporter was evicted. ||"I felt I had a voice and I would be believed," says Preece. "It is a positive thing that the game has moved on to a point where you don't feel as though you have to take things into your own hands. There are mechanisms where you can be heard."||Because of his own background as a mainly lower-league player, Preece naturally looks outside the high-profile Premier League role models and further down the pyramid for the "very uncomfortable" underlying reasons why he sees so few black faces opposing him in the dug-out.||"Unfortunately, it is that unconscious bias we talk about. People still don't see black people as leaders. It is so frustrating and difficult to talk about and it does make you angry," he says.||"There are so many black captains in the EFL. They are leaders. They can take on manager's jobs.||"There are a lot of black players in League One and Two who are more than capable of taking coaching or management jobs. When you look at the data, what chance have they got? I am sure a lot turn away and think 'I am not bothering, it is not worth it'.||"At the top level, you see certain players that don't get opportunities, that have had great careers at the top level, who are internationals, they want to manage, they want to coach, they have done their badges but they have seen they are good enough to work in academies or Under-21 teams, but as far as being the actual leader of a football club, they are not. Why? We are still asking that question. There are some answers but they are very uncomfortable. ||"If there is a reason for optimism it is because I do feel there is a bit of hope now. Through the Black Footballers Partnership, we have a voice. That is the important thing. There has to be a voice for change." ||Preece's advice to other would-be managers is to "believe you can change things" even if the opportunity is "challenging" as he has found several times in his career. ||"Believe in yourself and your ability. Sometimes you have to be humble enough. Believe that people will look at you for what you do and what you know."||Preece relishes his role. And after reaching 750 games as a manager, is now looking at making it to 1,000.||"I have had so many great experiences and am so lucky to be involved with something that I love," he says. ||"My passion for the game has never changed. If I didn't love what I did, there is no way I would have lasted this long."  ||And with that, Preece is off to talk with his part-time players who have been filtering in during our chat, each of them greeted with a smile and a positive word or two.|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65347429
Juventus 0-1 Napoli: Luciano Spalletti staying calm as his side move to brink of title||Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti said it isn't yet time for celebrating, despite Sunday's last-gasp 1-0 win at Juventus moving them to potentially one win from the Serie A title.||Giacomo Raspadori's stoppage-time winner moved Napoli 17 points clear, days after being knocked out of the Champions League by AC Milan.||If Napoli beat regional rivals Salernitana on Saturday and Lazio fail to win at Inter Milan the next day, Spalletti's side would be champions for the first time since 1990.||"We need to wait before we pop any bottles, because we still have a little way to go," said Spalletti.||"They played really well and it wasn't easy to do that so soon after being knocked out of the Champions League. I don't think we could have done any more tonight."||Barring a collapse in the final seven games of the season Napoli will win the league, the crowning glory of Spalletti's career which has seen him progress from lower league football as a player to the top of the Italian game.||The Scudetto would be his first league title since the two he won in Russia with Zenit Saint Petersburg in 2010 and 2012, and his first trophy in a major league since an Italian Cup with Roma in 2008.||The 64-year-old said: "It's obviously very satisfying to be here.||"It has been a tougher road here for me than for others who began from a higher level, those who earned respect from their playing careers and had the opportunity to lead a top team right from the start."||Formation  4-4-1-1||Formation  4-3-3||Match ends, Juventus 0, Napoli 1.||Second Half ends, Juventus 0, Napoli 1.||Foul by Juan Jesus (Napoli).||Federico Gatti (Juventus) wins a free kick in the attacking half.||Andr-Frank Zambo Anguissa (Napoli) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.||Foul by Andr-Frank Zambo Anguissa (Napoli).||Nicol Fagioli (Juventus) wins a free kick in the defensive half.||Substitution, Napoli.

Wrexham: 'Sky's the limit' for star-owned club targeting back-to-back promotions||Wrexham executive director Humphrey Ker believes the club can repeat promotion success in League Two next season.||The club, owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, ended a 15-year EFL exile with Saturday's 3-1 victory against Boreham Wood.||After celebrating the National League title they have set their sights high.||"We feel the sky's the limit for Wrexham because you look at the crowds we had in the stadium all season," said Ker.||"You look at the crowds that were outside the stadium [on Saturday], people that couldn't get a ticket that just wanted to be in town and close to the stadium and close to the action."||Wrexham have averaged crowds of around 10,000 at the Racecourse Stadium during a record-breaking campaign, and they have already started work on a new 5,500-seat stand which will increase the capacity to around 15,600.||Reynolds and McElhenney's involvement has also seen the club introduced to an international audience through the successful Welcome to Wrexham documentary series.||"I think our full-time announcement yesterday [for Saturday's win against Boreham Wood], the last time I checked, had 15 million views on Twitter," added Ker.||"The interest in this club is astronomical and we believe that the squad that we have right now, we have a very strong chance of going up again next year. ||"It gets more challenging the further up the pyramid we go, but we have real faith and confidence in the people we've got in the football club to take us in the right direction. ||"We want to do this again, we want to be having these parties next year and as many summers after that as we can possibly manage."||Ker's optimism for next season is not just based on a National League season that has delivered a record number of wins and points. The club also reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, beating Championship Coventry City before losing a replay to a Sheffield United side pushing for promotion back to the Premier League.||They have attracted a number of players from higher division clubs, including top scorer Paul Mullin who joined from Cambridge United in 2021, while ex-England goalkeeper Ben Foster came out of retirement to help Wrexham's promotion push and has admitted he is considering prolonging his career.||The club also hope future recruitment will be easier having returned to the Football League for the first time since 2008.||"Our mission will always be to try and get the best players we possibly can for each situation," Ker told the BBC Radio Wales Breakfast programme.||"I think previously we've had to pay a bit of a premium to get players to come down to the National League because of the stigma that surrounds non-League or Conference football, however you want to describe it, and as we go up we'll have less of a challenge in attracting people. ||"I know that Phil [manager Parkinson] and Les Read, who's been helping us as well on the recruitment side, are just inundated with incoming calls from players because this is a place that people want to come and play football."||Ker also dismissed suggestions that having gained promotion from the National League, Wrexham could fall foul of much stricter financial rules which govern sides in the EFL. ||Under the League's Salary Cost Management Protocol (SMCP) League Two clubs can spend a maximum of 55% of their turnover on wages.||"The salary caps and things that exist, or the spending caps, are tied to your revenue," said Ker.||"What you can't have is just rich owners coming in and paying massively over the odds and operating at gigantic losses.||"Now we actually generate an extraordinary amount of revenue because of the interest in the team and because of the merchandising, so to be honest with you we're not losing too much sleep about that, I think we'll fall well within the boundaries of what we are permitted to spend. ||"We also look at this team and think this is a team that beat Coventry City, that ran Sheffield United very close over two [games]. We've accrued a record number of points in the National League this year, we think we're ready to go again with some minor changes."||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65371929
Match of the Day Top 10: Lineker, Shearer & Richards rank the best Premier League celebrations||Which Premier League celebration is the best ever? ||Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debated that very question in the latest episode of Match of the Day Top 10.||From iconic moments to trademark moves, football fans are certain to remember all the celebrations on the list.||Here are their picks. See what you think, and then select the order you would rank them in. ||After a fruitful spell at Arsenal between 2006 and 2009, Emmanuel Adebayor made the switch to Manchester City for a reported 29m - a year into the club's Abu Dhabi-based ownership.||Two months into the 2009/10 season, the Togo international met his former club for the first time since the move, and was jeered by the away supporters throughout the match. ||With just 10 minutes to play, Adebayor made it 3-1 to City with a bullet header and ran the entire length of the pitch, knee-sliding in front of the Arsenal fans as his new club eventually ran out 4-2 winners.||The Premier League record goalscorer's low-key celebration is instantly recognisable - and an absolute classic. ||After finding the net, Shearer would raise his right arm and wheel away to soak in the acclaim from supporters. ||Occasionally, the Newcastle United legend would surprise fans by lifting both arms, but that was generally reserved for special goals.||In March 2015, a video of Wayne Rooney and Phil Bardsley boxing in a kitchen surfaced online just hours before Manchester United were due to take on Tottenham at Old Trafford. ||The Red Devils beat Spurs 3-0, with Rooney scoring the third, and the striker's dramatic celebration saw him punch the air a few times before falling back theatrically to mirror getting knocked out.||Following his 2009 departure from Manchester United, Cristiano Ronaldo rejoined the club in the summer of 2021. ||The Portugal icon brought back with him experience, an abundance of individual records and accolades, and a new celebration - which he had first debuted for Real Madrid back in 2013.||His twisting "Siiiiu" got a fair number of airings during his second spell at Old Trafford, with Ronaldo netting 27 times before he joined Saudi club Al Nassr.||Mario Balotelli was never far from controversy during his time as a Manchester City player. ||Just two days before the Manchester derby in 2011, the Italian's bathroom caught fire after a firework was set off in his house. ||The striker subsequently scored the opener in the 6-1 win over United, revealing a T-shirt under his top with the question "why always me?"||Most fans believe Peter Crouch busted out his famous 'robot' dance moves every single week. ||In fact, the former Stoke striker only 'did the robot' once in the Premier League, celebrating his 100th goal in the competition during a 1-1 draw with Everton in 2017. ||It gained popularity for its two prior showings, in England's 2006 World Cup warm-up matches versus Hungary and Jamaica, and will forever be associated with the forward.||How do you celebrate a goal as brilliant as Eric Cantona's chip in Manchester United's 5-0 win against Sunderland in 1996? You stand on the spot with arms aloft and take it all in, of course...||Former Newcastle United midfielder Temuri Ketsbaia wasn't always as joyful as the image above indicates, and that was certainly the case when he scored a last-minute winner against Bolton Wanderers in January 1998. ||The furious Georgian removed his boots and shirt and proceeded to kick the advertising hoardings repeatedly. ||Shearer even had to retrieve his team-mate's top from the crowd so he could continue. A very bizarre one indeed.||Whether it be for Newcastle United or Portsmouth, Lomana LuaLua would treat supporters to his iconic back-flip somersaults whenever he got on the scoresheet. ||Plenty of other footballers have unleashed similar acrobatics since, but LuaLua was arguably the trailblazer for such extravagant celebrations.||In 1994, Jurgen Klinsmann arrived at Tottenham from Monaco and the build-up to his debut was marred by claims he was a diver.  ||The German quickly endeared himself to Spurs fans, however, by scoring the winner on his debut in a 4-3 win over Sheffield United... and celebrating with an exaggerated dive.||Rank your best Premier League celebrations from 1-10.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65180498

Joe Cordina: Eddie Hearn backs Welsh fighter to unify super-featherweight division||Promoter Eddie Hearn says "superstar" Joe Cordina can unify the super-featherweight division and has promised bigger nights of boxing ahead in Wales.||Cordina regained the title he was stripped of because of injury with a split-decision win over Shavkatdzhon Rakhimov in Cardiff on Saturday night.||Hearn said Cordina was "carrying Welsh boxing on his shoulders," before he won a superb fight against Rakhimov.||"That win cements Joe as the world's best 130lbs fighter," Hearn said.||"I said that Joe was the only chance Wales had of continuing to have big-time boxing coming back and that was an unbelievable atmosphere.||"Now it is on to the next step. It is time to move on, to bigger arenas, bigger stadiums and bigger fights.||"You don't see this in boxing, beating world champions in successive fights with the knockout of the year and now a fight of the year contender.||"From a legacy point of view and a financial point of view, now is the time to push on."||Cordina was pushed to his limits by Rakhimov, as the Welshman returned to the ring for the first time in 10 months since he initially won the world title with a second round KO of Kenichi Ogawa in Cardiff in June.||The 31-year old was stripped of his title because of hand surgery, but reclaimed it in a sensational contest with Rakhimov who showed the fortitude of a champion despite being floored by a left hook in the second round.||Cordina took the split-decision 111-116, 115-112 and 114-113 on the cards in a contest that saw over 1,300 shots thrown.||Hearn, who has promoted Cordina since the former European gold medal winner turned professional, believes the decorated amateur can now look to establish himself as the dominant force in the super-featherweight division. ||Former WBO and WBC champion Shakur Stevenson has moved up to lightweight and Hearn wants to see Cordina fight some of the other champions. ||"There are obtainable unification fights out there now the division is not all about Shakur Stevenson," Hearn told BBC Sport Wales.||"When Joe beat Ogawa we were talking about a unification fight with Shakur Stevenson.||"He isn't there now, but the goal remains the same.||"Joe wants belts and I'd love to see him have a crack at being undisputed one day.||"I have always liked the WBC championship, I think O'Shaquie Foster is a good fighter, he's getting on, but he's good.||"But honestly, I would match Joe with any of the current champions. There is no marquee name in the division other than Joe Cordina right now."||Emanuel Navarrete is the WBO champion and Hector Luis Garcia holds the WBA title.||"If Cardiff continues to back Joe Cordina, we can get those champions over for unification fights, that won't be a problem... I would love to bring the champions here if I can," added Hearn.||"But we can't do it at the arena, it is a great arena, great atmosphere, but we have outgrown it, it has to be in a stadium.||"If the country doesn't get behind Joe Cordina when we make our move to bigger venues I don't know what more we can do, because he should be a national hero for his last two fights.||"Joe is a superstar. He's the biggest Welsh boxing star since Joe Calzaghe. He's a world class fighter and can be a superstar."||Cordina said he was proud to have won his toughest fight to date.||He admitted to thinking about quitting the sport as he endured "dark days" over the past few months and he has a large scar on his right hand as a reminder. ||"It was my hardest fight for sure and I knew it would be," he said.||"I had a few questions asked of me and I answered them.||"I was surprised by the scoring. The judge who had me losing by five rounds, I don't know what he was thinking.||"A lot of his shots were hitting my arms, my gloves, my shots were cleaner.||"I feel I have got my life back, winning the title I never lost. I sacrifice a lot, being away from my wife and three kids, but everything I do is about securing their future.||"It is hard being away, but the sacrifices have paid off because now I am a two-time world champion."||https://www.bbc.com//sport/boxing/65370082
Garth Crooks' Team of the Week: Jota, Rice, Guehi, Mahrez||Pick your team of the week||At the end of every round of fixtures, BBC football pundit Garth Crooks is on hand to give you his Team of the Week.||With the Premier League and the FA Cup semi-finals both included this week, who has he picked this time? Take a look and then pick your own team below and share it on social media. As ever, Garth also has his say on the game's big talking points in the Crooks of the Matter.||Jordan Pickford (Everton): If Everton hope to survive this season and remain in the Premier League, they are going to need Jordan Pickford at his best. Regular readers will know I have a preference for Newcastle's Nick Pope in the England goal given a choice but there is no doubt Pickford's form has improved. The England number one seems to have ironed out those glitches in concentration that so often resulted in conceding a goal. Against Crystal Palace, there was little sign of the old Pickford who time after time came to Everton's rescue and, in the end, the keeper was responsible for the Toffees coming away with a valuable point. ||Timothy Castagne (Leicester): These were three massive points for Leicester. I'm still struggling with the departure of Brendan Rodgers from the King Power Stadium but Leicester fans tell me he had to go. OK, but to replace Rodgers with Dean Smith after his disappointing time at Norwich - what sort of appointment is that? What Smith has brought to the Leicester City dressing room, as part of his management team, is John Terry. The former England captain certainly knows everything you need to know about the art of defending and they will need every inch of his experience during their remaining games. Leicester made it difficult for Wolves and, I must admit, looked more organised. Their winning goal came from Timothy Castagne. A right footed full-back with a left-footed finish in open play. Jamie Vardy couldn't have finished it better.   ||Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace): The ball for Jordan Ayew to run onto from Marc Guehi during the game's early exchanges was quite brilliant by the Crystal Palace centre-back. You don't often see such cultured passes played forward from central defenders - they are normally five-yard passes, a desperate boot up front or a square ball that simply leaves another player with the same problem. It was the sort of pass that made people sit up and take notice. So too was his challenge on Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The Palace defender did just enough to force the Everton centre-forward to rush his shot as he was about to stick the ball into the back of the net. Meanwhile, Palace continue to move up the table with a manager who almost certainly will not be with them next season. Vincent Kompany would be a much better bet for them than Chelsea, for example. Read why I think the owners running Stamford Bridge need to get a grip in the Crooks of the Matter below. ||Victor Lindelof (Manchester United): I originally selected Luke Shaw in my team after what I thought was a magnificent performance against Brighton at centre-back in what is becoming a more familiar role for the England international these days. However, it became impossible for me to ignore Victor Lindelof having not only performed brilliantly in the FA Cup semi-final, having spent the best part of the season out of the Manchester United starting line-up, but he then went on to score the winning penalty in the shootout. I have not heard one word of complaint from the defender about having been left out of the team, while his conduct whenever he played has been exemplary. I hope Erik ten Hag rewards him with a cup final start.||Declan Rice (West Ham): He scored an absolute cracker against Gent in the Europa Conference League in midweek and then hit another belter against Bournemouth days later. Declan Rice is once again proving to be an instrumental figure in a West Ham revival. I'm not entirely sure where this West Ham performance came from. They would have gleaned some confidence from their comeback against Arsenal but they went to the Vitality Stadium and absolutely obliterated the Cherries. The win puts the Hammers on 34 points and takes the pressure off David Moyes' team after securing a semi-final place in a European competition. Declan Rice has to be worth 80m of anyone's money.||Martin Odegaard (Arsenal): I said it only a few weeks ago that goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale's entire season will depend on the next seven games. He will either pick up a Premier League title medal or have to console himself with a Champions League spot. If he continues to make the sort of error that cost Arsenal so dearly in the opening minutes against a battling Southampton, then it's the latter for him. The Arsenal keeper had a good think before making a poor pass between two opposing players and paid the price for allowing his pride to get the better of him. It's just as well Arsenal have Martin Odegaard in their ranks. The Norway international possesses great leadership skills and a cool head to match. His calm and calculated one-two on the edge of the box with Ben White prior to his superb finish said loud and clear that Odegaard is one man Arsenal can certainly count on in the final stages of the season. I'm not entirely sure about the rest. ||James Ward-Prowse (Southampton): This was an extraordinary game for so many different reasons. Who would have thought the injury to William Saliba would have caused Arsenal so much pain? The Frenchman's absence has had a devastating effect on the team's ambitions to win the league title. A two-goal lead surrendered at Liverpool and West Ham in consecutive matches suggested Arsenal were feeling the pressure. To go 3-1 down at home to Southampton suggests they are struggling to cope under the weight of it. Furthermore, reports that Saliba won't be back any time soon only serves to compound the situation. Wednesday night's game against Manchester City - the only team that can realistically stop them from winning the title - is now crucial. Nothing short of a victory will do. Arsenal's comeback was impressive but not as impressive as Southampton's performance on the night and especially James Ward-Prowse. His last-minute block on Reiss Nelson's attempt on goal was sensational. I reckon there are 10 points achievable for the Saints from six games which will put them on 34 points - and I don't think that will be enough. ||Harry Wilson (Fulham): Harry Wilson makes my team selection for the second consecutive week. His goal at Everton was only matched by his overall performance. However against a struggling Leeds his superb finish demonstrated an appetite for goals that in the absence of Aleksandar Mitrovic was desperately needed at Craven Cottage. What the suspension of the Serbian centre-forward may have done is force Fulham to find an alternative way to score goals by playing through the midfield a little more and not throwing the ball forward at every opportunity to Mitrovic. Their recent style of play has certainly suited the likes of Harry Wilson whose determination to cover the ground and get into the box has been very evident.             ||Joelinton (Newcastle): This was a horror show by Tottenham. Five goals down away from home against the team you are competing with for a Champions League place? Chairman Daniel Levy should insist the players reimburse travelling fans who no doubt spent a considerable amount of money to watch their team capitulate. Hugo Lloris' contribution to Tottenham's first half beggared belief and it was a relief not to see him return for the second half. Newcastle on the other hand looked as though they had completely recovered from their mauling at Villa Park and gone some way to securing a top-four finish. My man of the match and arguably Newcastle's player of the season is Joelinton. When he arrived at Newcastle he looked anything but a top-four player. He is now ever present in a Newcastle side that's going places. ||Diogo Jota (Liverpool): Liverpool find themselves chasing a top-four place with seven games to play and with no guarantees they will make it on this performance. They looked mightily impressive away at Leeds in midweek but for much of the game against Nottingham Forest they looked like they were struggling. Fortunately they had Diogo Jota on hand, who is no Sadio Mane by the way, but is looking sharp in front of goal again. No-one expected Nottingham Forest to go and win at Anfield, least of all Steve Cooper, who left his leading goalscorer Brennan Johnson on the bench which was rather a pity really. With Johnson in their starting line-up, alongside Taiwo Awoniyi, Forest might have come away with something. Forest may be in the bottom three and staring at relegation but their second-half performance suggests that if they do go down they won't go quietly.||Riyad Mahrez (Manchester City): What a superb FA Cup semi-final hat-trick this was. The penalty sent the keeper the wrong way, his run for his second goal split the Sheffield United defence in two and left the keeper on his backside, while his third goal with the inside of his left foot gave the keeper no chance. Riyad Mahrez is looking every inch the player he looked at Leicester City. He's playing with the same swagger and confidence he did when they won the Premier League title. Mahrez's contribution to Manchester City's fortunes has put them on course for the Treble. Pep Guardiola won Spain's version of the treble - and I wouldn't bet against him doing it again here. ||When a footballer of Thiago Silva's reputation feels compelled to stop in the mixed zone after a Champions League defeat and give an interview in his native tongue in order not to be misunderstood, then his club had better sit up and take notice.||The Brazil international said if Chelsea did not "stop and put a strategy in place" they would suffer another difficult campaign next season. I don't think I have ever heard a more cold, calm and calculated warning from a senior player at the top of his game delivered in years.||If ever Todd Boehly needed to hear from someone in his camp he can trust he should look no further than Silva and take his warning very seriously.||The owner should start by finding out what exactly that strategy actually looks like by employing a top-class manager and technical director.||Silva has no axe to grind, he's coming to the end of a magnificent career, and clearly wants the best for the club.||What Chelsea must also not do is appoint a 35-year old who has less experience in the game than Silva himself.||Employing Julian Nagelsmann is not the answer; if you are going to appoint a captain of a jumbo 747 then that captain must have more experience than some of its passengers and that is what appointing Nagelsmann will represent to those players at Chelsea - yet another novice. ||Let's be clear here: Chelsea are in a crisis, and Boehly's responsibility is to count the beans, not to get the results.

Man Utd reach FA Cup final: Why Erik ten Hag has chance of 'glorious conclusion' to first season||Manchester United's season may have had its dark moments but can still end as a highly successful campaign of transition for manager Erik ten Hag after they reached the FA Cup final with victory over Brighton.||The glass half-empty outsiders may look in at Old Trafford affairs and focus on the 4-0 humiliation at Brentford in the second Premier League game of the season, six goals conceded at Manchester City then seven at Liverpool, as well as the embarrassing Europa League quarter-final collapse against Sevilla. ||What is far more significant in the overall ledger is that in Ten Hag's opening salvo they have won their first trophy since 2017 in the League Cup, look in prime position to return to the Champions League via the top four, and have now reached a second domestic Wembley showpiece this term as they prepare to face Manchester City in the FA Cup final on 3 June.||One side of the equation undoubtedly reflects the distance Ten Hag needs to travel but the other demonstrates, for all the very obvious faults of a team still requiring a major overhaul to deliver an injection of quality and mental strength, the Dutch manager has got them moving in the right direction following the years on the margins. ||On that basis, if United can add a place in the top four to the League Cup going into the first all-Manchester FA Cup final, then Ten Hag can reflect on his first season with satisfaction, with the knowledge he still has so much to do to take United closer to where they want to be.||There are problems at Manchester United that many performances have highlighted but Ten Hag gives the appearance of a manager who can finally find solutions - and if he can do it while winning trophies and putting them back in the Champions League, all the better. ||It has certainly been the very definition of a mixed bag this term and goalkeeper David de Gea could be labelled the poster boy for the rollercoaster quality of United's performances after the last four days. ||De Gea came into the FA Cup semi-final under heavy scrutiny following his calamitous part as Manchester United subsided to defeat in Seville. ||And yet, in keeping with the two faces Erik ten Hag's side can display, De Gea delivered an exemplary performance to ensure they came out on the right side of a semi-final they entered as underdogs in the eyes of many observers. ||He looked a bag of nerves in Spain, especially with the ball at his feet, but here against this fine Brighton side in a semi-final that fell short of expectations, De Gea delivered when it mattered. ||De Gea started by showing athleticism to turn away Alexis Mac Allister's early free-kick while he also denied Julio Enciso with a fine save to turn his powerful effort over the top.||He was powerless to stop six Brighton penalties but, once the unfortunate Solly March skied the seventh, Victor Lindelof stepped forward to complete the formalities.||It gives Manchester United what may yet prove to be an opportunity to deny arch-rivals Manchester City a repeat of their historic feat of 1999, when Sir Alex Ferguson's side won the Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup.||This was nowhere near a classic and no sound judge would put Manchester United anywhere near the supreme quality of Manchester City, or even Arsenal on this season's evidence, but make no mistake that Ten Hag's renewal is a huge step forward from the misery suffered under first Ole Gunnar Solskjaer then Ralf Rangnick last season - the latter claiming the club needed "open heart surgery" after they finished sixth, but 13 points off the top four.||Ten Hag still has many ills to cure but he is at least prescribing the sort of medication that is returning Manchester United to something like their former health.||This performance, based more on grim determination and a refusal to buckle against a team of such enterprise in Roberto De Zerbi's Brighton, was far more to Ten Hag's liking than the one he witnessed in the 3-0 loss to Sevilla on Thursday. ||He said: "On Thursday I saw a team I didn't recognise but today we went back to usual." ||Manchester City will be firm favourites when the two sides meet in the FA Cup final but United's confidence will be boosted by the fact they beat Pep Guardiola's side in the derby at Old Trafford in January. ||Ten Hag will be looking to strengthen in many areas once that showpiece final is concluded but for now, he will be delighted with the opportunity to give his first year at the helm a glorious conclusion. ||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65369638

Craig Breen: 'Have fun, life is short' - Rallying remembers late driver||"Don't forget to enjoy it. You have to have fun. Life is very short."||Motorsport was left stunned when Craig Breen, whose words above ring true now more than ever, died in a pre-event testing accident before Rally Croatia. ||With nine podiums and 34 stage wins, Breen's talent behind the wheel was clear to see, but it was his personality that people will remember most with his piercing blue eyes lighting up with a beaming smile.||With the blessing of his family and co-driver James Fulton, who was uninjured in the crash, his Hyundai team took part in Rally Croatia, which was won by Toyota's Elfyn Evans on Sunday. ||It is one of the most exciting World Rally Championship seasons for years but the entire campaign will continue under a cloud following Breen's passing aged 33.||His passion for the sport was unrivalled. He was the ultimate fan turned competitor. Rallying was in every fibre of his DNA and the childhood videos of him driving toy cars around his house meant it was destiny he would reach the WRC. ||When he wasn't competing in the WRC he was back in his native Ireland, driving in historic rallies or competing in the Irish Tarmac Championship.||It doesn't seem fair or right that Breen is no longer with us. Even after the weekend in Croatia it is hard to comprehend. He was a driver in his prime, that first victory seemed like only a matter of time but, more importantly, a human being so full of passion and joy. ||Breen's passing leaves a hole in the sport, but that is minor compared with the hole in the lives of his loved ones. ||Sadly, Breen's passing is not the first time there has been tragedy in his career. In 2012, his best friend and co-driver, Gareth Roberts, was killed in an accident in Italy.||It hit Breen hard, but he had carried on in the memory of Roberts, or Jaffa, as he was affectionately known.||When he got his first podium in Finland in 2016 he burst into tears and was overcome by emotion: "It's been such a road to get here. I'm missing my main man and I know he is looking down on me. I'm so, so happy."||He is now reunited with his best friend.||Breen was fuelled by passion. When the end of stage interviews came about you never quite knew what you were going to get but knew it would be raw, both in bad times and good, and his heart was always on his sleeve.||But it was his last interview that will live longest in the memory. After a difficult year with Ford, he returned to Hyundai for 2023 and finished second on his first outing in Sweden in February.||"Don't let anybody ever put you down, because only you know your true potential," he said with tears in his eyes.||Truer words have never been spoken. ||It was fitting that Evans won Rally Croatia, with co-driver Scott Martin by his side. Martin was Breen's co-driver for five seasons and navigated the Irishman to two Circuit of Ireland victories and his maiden podium in the WRC in 2016. ||The outburst of emotion from Martin as their Toyota crossed the line said a lot. The top tier of rallying is a small place and although they are all competitors, they all share the same passion. Every single driver and co-driver was numb, knowing they had lost one of their own.||It is a sport that requires the highest level of dedication and concentration, so the fact any crew was able to perform in the circumstances was beyond impressive.||Hyundai's tribute was touching, running a one-off livery in Breen's honour with the colours of the Irish flag. The team prepared Breen's car for the rally and it sat in the service park, but when the rest of the paddock headed for the stages his unmanned car stayed in place. The silence was poignant. ||The WRC also announced that Breen's number 42 would be retired until the end of the season. Some have suggested that is a move that should be made permanent.||Northern Ireland's Kris Meeke, a close friend of Breen, will take over the Irishman's seat in the Portuguese Rally Championship as Hyundai decided to continue to run a second car in Breen's honour. ||Meeke, who won in Finland when Breen secured his first podium, said the decision to fill in for Breen "was not made lightly" but "I knew he would tell me to accept and this is how I will honour him". ||While Evans took a superb victory in the main class, in the Junior WRC it was two up-and-coming Irish stars who impressed in the most difficult of circumstances. ||Breen took on a mentor role with the next generation of Irish stars with Motorsport Ireland and William Creighton and Eamonn Kelly both did him and everyone back home proud.||While an accident for Creighton accident took away a top result, his 10 winning stage times were unbeaten and Kelly's maiden Junior WRC victory meant the Irish flag was represented on top of the podium.||Josh McErlean was set to drive in WRC2 but withdrew his entry following Breen's accident. McErlean was invited by Breen to attend that fateful test and he had a close relationship with both the late driver and Fulton. It was a tough decision to withdraw but there is no doubt, when the time is right, he will be back at the sharp end and doing Breen's memory proud.||It wasn't just Irish drivers Breen mentored. There is a brilliant video on social media of him teaching Kenyan driver McRae Kimathi how to make a proper cup to tea. His passion was there both on the stages and away from them - and that is what we shall miss.||Thank you for everything, Craig. We'll forever raise a cuppa in your name. ||Bruce Anstey says doctors are confounded as to how he is still alive after having chemotherapy treatment following a second cancer diagnosis in 2018.||Latest news, video and analysis||Visit the Elite League's official website|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings||https://www.bbc.com//sport/motorsport/65368539
Newcastle 6-1 Tottenham: It's too late to save Spurs' season - Jermaine Jenas analysis||Jermaine Jenas was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan before the news that Christian Stellini had been sacked as Tottenham manager.||Everyone at Tottenham will talk about fighting and pulling together after Sunday's embarrassing defeat at Newcastle, but I feel like it's too far down the road for that now.||The team's momentum has completely gone, and the players clearly have no belief.||They played without any kind of a plan at St James' Park, but that was hardly a surprise after what we've already seen from them this season. ||They are in a complete mess, but for me that stems from what is happening at the club off the pitch, and the total lack of direction that comes from the very top.||Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris was interviewed after the Newcastle game and, when he was asked a question about the powers that be, he kind of batted it off.||Instead he said the players have a responsibility to perform, whatever is going on behind the scenes. ||There was a part of me that liked that, because as a player you are always 100% responsible for maintaining your own standards for yourself, the team and the club, regardless of what is happening. Lloris knew they had to do much, much better.||But it is not a coincidence that Tottenham are playing this badly at the same time that everything else at the club, from the top down, is a complete and utter shambles. ||This kind of mess is nothing new at Spurs - you can take it back as far as you like.||I can't think of another club that would sack their manager the week before a cup final, like they did with Jose Mourinho ahead of the Carabao Cup final in 2021, but Tottenham did.||This time, they got rid of Antonio Conte with 10 Premier League games to go. Conte played his own part in that decision with his behaviour, of course, but how can you make a change at that stage of the season without having a new manager to come in?||At least bring in someone who will give you fresh ideas, a new look, some energy - anything that might provide a bounce to secure a Champions League spot, at a time when the club were actually in the top four.||Instead, Spurs appointed Cristian Stellini, Conte's number two.||By doing that, it felt like they had given up on the season, and that way of thinking has fed through to the team as well.||Half of me feels sorry for the Spurs players right now, because of everything else that is going on.||But the other half can't believe quite how poor they've been when I've watched them in the past few weeks.||The least they could have done is got on the ball to see the game out against Southampton in Conte's final game, or dominated possession when Everton were down to 10 men for half an hour in Stellini's first game in charge.||They couldn't do either, and after riding their luck to beat Brighton, they were outplayed at home by a Bournemouth side battling relegation.||Then, on Sunday, they turned up at St James' Park looking almost shellshocked, totally unprepared for what would happen.||Every player knows what to expect when you play at that stadium - even during the years when Newcastle were nearer the bottom of the league, it was always like a cauldron and you would still get a tough game.||So, with the Magpies absolutely flying and about to have their best finish since I was there 20 years ago, Spurs should have known what they were about to walk into. ||You could tell by their faces that they weren't ready at all, and that was one of the reasons they completely fell apart the way they did.||The Spurs players will be going through hell right now, because what is happening to them is embarrassing. Not only are they suffering, they will be dreading every game.||They are at home on Thursday against Manchester United and there will be 64,000 Spurs fans in their stadium, all baying for blood after watching their team capitulate and their season collapse.||Those supporters are going to make their feelings clear to the powers that be, and probably to some of the players as well.||That spilled over last week with the treatment Davinson Sanchez got when he came on against Bournemouth, and was booed every time he touched the ball, and again when he was taken off.||I don't agree with that whatsoever, but Spurs fans are a frustrated bunch at the moment and I think anyone could be the target on Thursday.||I really can't see things getting any better for them this season, either. You can forget about them moving up the table for starters - they are more likely to be heading in the opposite direction.||Aston Villa, Liverpool and Brighton are all playing better football, and I think all three of them will finish above Spurs - so things are pretty bleak.||All they can do now is get to the end of the season and have a reset, but it is going to have to be a quick one.||Conte's exit was a great opportunity to get a new manager in for the final few weeks of the season, to have a look at what needs to be done in the summer. Instead, Spurs will be starting from scratch, yet again.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65367961
Afghanistan women's cricket team: In limbo and in exile in Australia||Nahida Sapan, an all-rounder in Afghanistan women's cricket team, was at university in Kabul when the Taliban retook control of the country on 15 August 2021. ||"My teacher said you all have to go to your homes. We all got up and I saw the Taliban on the way home. I was really, really scared," she tells the BBC. ||Once she got home, Sapan grabbed her cricket kit and hid it in the basement. She was also the scorer for the team, so she went into the backyard and burned all her scorebooks. ||Sapan, whose brother worked for the previous government, says her family then started receiving calls and messages from the Taliban.||"They were direct threats. They were saying: 'we will find you and if we find you, we will not let you live. If we find one of you we will find all of you,'" she says. ||"I had a panic attack, my hands were shaking. I was so scared, I was traumatised. Every time I heard a knock at the door, all I could think was 'they've found us, they're going to kill us.'"||The people sending her threats are now serving in government, she says. ||Over the coming months, Sapan and her family moved from house to house to avoid detection. Eventually she managed to escape over the border to Pakistan, before meeting up with the rest of her team in Australia. ||They are now beyond the clutches of the Taliban, but Sapan and her team-mates are still waiting, their careers resting on the whims of others.||Afghanistan's first national women's team was formed in 2010, nine years after the Taliban fell in the face of a US-led military coalition. ||In the early years the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) prevented the women's team from playing at several international tournaments, saying it received "Taliban threats".||But as the profile of the men's team grew, the ACB had to start taking the women's game more seriously. The International Cricket Council (ICC) requires its 12 full members - Afghanistan became one in 2017 - to have a national women's team. This led to 25 female cricketers being awarded contracts in November 2020.||The Taliban's return to power less than a year later destroyed the dreams of women across Afghanistan, including its cricketers. The Taliban has banned women from universities, parks and sports and raided the homes of female athletes.||Sapan, 20, is one of more than 20 members of the Afghan women's cricket team now living in Australia after fleeing Afghanistan. ||Another who escaped was 17-year-old bowler Aysha Yousofzai. ||She recalls her terrifying journey through Taliban checkpoints as she made her way to Pakistan. ||"We had our faces covered because we weren't allowed to show our faces to men, so they didn't know who we were. We were scared but thankfully they didn't say we had to show our faces," she says. ||Yousofzai managed to make it to Pakistan, and the Australian government arranged a flight for her and other members of the squad to come to Australia. But some of her friends and family weren't as lucky.||"Nobody is doing good now in Afghanistan, especially women. They don't have the right to study, work, or travel without a man," she says.||Yousofzai and Sapan have settled into life in Australia. They are both studying and are appreciative of the freedoms they have in comparison with women back in Afghanistan. ||"Living in Australia actually feels like living. When we were in Afghanistan it was like we were just existing," Sapan says. "Now I feel hope for my future, I feel hope for tomorrow, I feel hope that I can make my dreams come true."||But while they are thankful to the Australian government, they have been left feeling let down by cricket's global governing body, the ICC. ||Members of the Afghanistan women's team say they have still had no contact from the ICC, despite it setting up the Afghanistan Working Group in 2021external-link to "review the status of the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) and cricket in Afghanistan". The women's team wrote to the ICC in December but the body said their status is an issue for the ACB.||"They didn't let any of our team know about the decisions they are making about our future," Sapan says. "They went to Dubai twice to talk about us but we didn't even know, we just heard through the internet. Nobody has contacted us to ask how we feel, or what we want."|| As a full member of the ICC, Afghanistan should have a women's side in place.|| The Afghan women's team has requested that the ICC recognises them as the official women's team in Australia, and for some of the funds allocated to the ACB be redirected to them. ||But in March, the ICC "significantly" raised the ACB's budget without providing any update on the women's team.||The lack of support means the women cannot regularly train together and have been unable to arrange any official matches. ||"I do not want the ICC to forget us or forget the girls in Afghanistan that still have hope of playing cricket. There are a lot of girls in Afghanistan who dream of becoming cricket players," Sapan says.||Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at campaign group Human Rights Watch, said the ICC needs to recognise the women's national team in Australia, but also press for women to be able to play in Afghanistan. ||If the ACB fails to comply, Worden says Afghanistan should be suspended by the ICC, which would mean the men's team would also be unable to play. ||"Rules are rules. That's what sport is about," Worden says.||"Let's say if New Zealand all of a sudden said we're only sending our male team to compete in international competitions, the ICC would and should have something to say about that.||"Why is there an ugly double standard on Afghanistan?"||The Taliban has openly supported men's cricket, knowing how widely loved the game is by Afghans. Worden believes that the threat of the men being suspended from the international game could act as a "pressure point" on the Taliban to lift restrictions on women playing sport.||"Right now it's cost free for the Taliban to ban Afghan women players from sport," she said. ||Both Yousofzai and Sapan say they do not want to see the men's team affected.||A spokesman for the ICC said it "remains committed to supporting the Afghanistan Cricket Board and are not penalising the ACB, or their players for abiding by the laws set by the government of their country". ||"The relationship with players in any of the ICC's Member countries is managed by the Board in that country, the ICC does not get involved. Similarly, the authority to field men's and women's national teams lies solely with the Member Board in any country, not with the ICC.||"The ICC will continue to constructively use its influence to assist the ACB in developing cricket and playing opportunities for both men and women in Afghanistan."||The ACB did not respond to a request for comment.||Sapan and Yousofzai both dream of one day returning to their homeland.||"I would love to be in Afghanistan and play for Afghanistan because that's where I was born, that's where I feel I belong," Yousofzai says. "If there is freedom of speech, gender equality, the opportunities I have in Australia  I'd love to be there. But if there is not, then no."||Both women want to one day become psychologists, and to be active in promoting gender equality in Afghanistan and Australia. ||But right now they simply want to be able to play the game they love.|| "I want my team back because I worked really hard. I faced many challenges to achieve my dream to be part of the national team  but now I can't play under the name of Afghanistan," Yousofzai says.||"I just want my rights and to be treated as a human. I just want them to treat me like they treat male players in Afghanistan."|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/cricket/65263457
Naples: A city on the brink as Napoli close in on first title in 33 years||Naples is a city on the brink. You can see it, hear it, feel it. It's in the eyes and the smiles, the playful chatter and swaggering strides. Neapolitans can taste it, they're living every moment of it. ||Napoli are 16 points clear in Serie A and cantering towards a first title since 1990. Flags hailing what will be the club's third championship hang from balconies, banners with "100% campione" ripple in the breeze. Even the usually superstitious Neapolitans can't help but acknowledge this is their year.||Clinch the Scudetto too early and some fear the city won't cope with a party 33 years in the making. Win the Champions League too? Well, the "skies will fall," beams Daniele 'Decibel' Bellini. "It's magical."||Provisions are in place for a party on 4 June - the final day of the season - but Napoli's wait for a first championship since Diego Maradona strolled these narrow streets could end in the next few weeks. Fifteen points from their final 10 games will make it certain, even if second-placed Lazio win all of theirs.||In the Quartieri Spagnoli, throughout Naples' historic centre, up to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona in Fuorigrotta and beyond, the streets are decked with blue and white festoons. Buildings and steps have been painted the same hues.||Life-size cutouts of the current squad stand in one piazza, club shirts and player posters are pegged to washing lines in alleyways and youngsters queue for half a block to buy Napoli-coloured panino at popular sandwich shop Con Mollica o Senza.external-link||Hotel rooms for the next couple of months have nearly all gone. Expats wanting to celebrate, football fans intrigued by Napoli's story and visitors unexpectedly caught up in this historic moment are descending on the city. Sporting success coincides with a tourist boom.||"Naples is experiencing a moment of self-recognition and rediscovery of its greatness," says author Angelo Forgione.||When Maradona inspired Napoli to a first Scudetto in 1987, fans placed a banner outside the city's largest cemetery proclaiming: "You don't know what you missed." Now, a generation too young to remember such glory are living it themselves.||"I was six months old in 1990 but I grew up watching VHS of Diego Maradona," says Vincenzo Credendino, from CalcioNapoli24 TV. "Now this Scudetto is like reconnecting with that time."||Tributes to Luciano Spalletti's players intertwine with endless Maradona artwork. He is everywhere in Naples' charmingly gritty and dizzyingly chaotic labyrinth of streets - bar windows, bumper stickers, on billboards and etched across crumbling walls in giant murals.||At Bar Nilo, a strand of Maradona's hair rotates as part of a shrine to the Argentine. In an underground museum the belongings acquired by his maid's son when Maradona left the city are on display.||"Maradona is like God here," says 23-year-old fan Maria Roberta De Iesu. "He gave people hope. Neapolitans see themselves in Maradona."||When Maradona arrived for a world record fee from Barcelona in July 1984, the city was still on its knees from an earthquake that killed almost 2,500 people four years earlier. Feuds between the Camorra, the region's mafia, were as bitter as ever, unemployment was huge and the Bank of Naples was facing bankruptcy.||"Yet in a Naples on the bottom, Napoli, with the help of politics, managed to buy the strongest and most expensive footballer in the world and touch the sky," adds Forgione. ||Then president Corrado Ferlaino had to lean on the city's mayor to help finance the deal, fans offered contributions to help get it over the line, anything to get Maradona.||'El Pibe de Oro' was everything to Naples, and Naples was everything to him. The city resonated with its Golden Boy not just because he inspired their club to two Serie A titles and a Uefa Cup but because they recognised him. He was anti-establishment, he echoed their principles and shouldered their concerns.||"Maradona was really good with his tongue, his mouth, his attitude," explains Credendino. "He understood how to get the heart of the Neapolitan people, he touched the right chords."||Maradona, despite his relationship with the Neapolitan mafia, brought "justice to the people" after struggles against the north that date back more than a century to the unification of Italy, says culture expert Francesco Carignani.||"He had many problems in his life but in Naples we only remember him for the joy," adds fan Paolo Cimmino. "We connect him as a man to a conqueror - the south won versus the north."||No club south of Rome has won Serie A since the Napoli of Maradona, Careca, Ciro Ferrara and a young Gianfranco Zola in 1990, and Neapolitans still endure hostile taunts from their northern rivals about crime, poverty, cholera outbreaks and calls for Mount Vesuvius to erupt over the city.||People here "are first of all Neapolitans and then Italian", explains Bellini, Napoli's iconic stadium announcer. They have their own language, culture and history. Naples was once a thriving European capital, it remains a city of intriguing architecture, Caravaggio, pizza. Most of all, there is an intensity to life in Campania.||"Southern people in Italy, they live everything with love, with so much emotion, in different ways to the north," adds Cimmino. ||Napoli had to fall before they could rise again. Financial decline, relegation and bankruptcy followed the glory years but the fans remained. More than 50,000 attended a game in Serie C in 2004-05.||"For our city soccer is so important," explains journalist Elena Lopresti. "It is not only football, it is a social instrument, a tool to develop us as a society."||Film producer Aurelio de Laurentiis seized an opportunity to purchase the club in 2004 and restore top-flight and European football to Napoli, the fourth-most well-supported club in Italy after Juventus, Milan and Inter, but one whose fanbase is concentrated in the region, rather than spread "from the Alps to Sicily" as Forgione says of the big three.||"De Laurentiis had a parachute," adds Credendino. "It was the love of the people, always ready to go to the stadium, always ready to support the team."||Naples, Forgione explains, is a rare European metropolis represented by a single club. "Napoli's victory is the victory of identity, of those who live it completely," he adds.||"In Naples, football is everything," says Cimmino. "It is joy, it is love, it is fun, it is sadness. It is a way to escape from the daily problems, a way to have fun with the people and party, and this period is happiness."||The De Laurentiis era has been characterised by astute recruitment - Edinson Cavani, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Jorginho, Gonzalo Higuain - profitable sales, and falling short in the title race.||It was only last summer, after another championship bid slipped away, that ultras promised to return boss Spalletti's stolen Fiat Panda on the condition he left the club.||"Now he deserves a Ferrari, not a Panda," laughs journalist Credendino. ||Spalletti is not from Naples, but he shares that Neapolitan passion. After being sacked by Inter, he spent two years on his farm in Tuscany before taking on the Napoli job. Now he lives by the training ground working relentlessly to deliver the Scudetto.||Maradona was the face of Napoli's previous triumph but this time unfamiliar heroes have emerged - cleverly acquired by sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli and fuelled by Spalletti's coaching.||"Giuntoli is the man of this miracle," says Credendino, despite some fans fretting when the club sold high-profile stars Kalidou Koulibaly, Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens last year.||"Giuntoli discovered Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, he discovered Victor Osimhen, Kim Min-jae," adds Cimmino. "Spalletti makes this talent, makes this character. He can find the right keys to get the best of all the players. [Slovak midfielder Stanislav] Lobotka now looks like Iniesta, he looks like Xavi."||On a sold-out match day against Milan, outside the stadium that bears Maradona's name - an amphitheatre worthy of the Greeks who founded Neapolis, the "new city" - kids sport the mask of top scorer Osimhen and Georgian flags fly for irrepressible winger Kvaratskhelia. ||There are a sprinkling of Boca and Argentina jerseys too, and, if there is a likeness to Maradona in this team, it is 22-year-old Kvaratskhelia. Signed from Dinamo Batumi last summer, he's aptly been dubbed "Kvaradona", but Cimmino sees him like Gianluigi Lentini at Torino or Kaka during his Milan years.||"He is incredibly unpredictable in the field," adds Credendino. "But if Maradona was a demigod, Kvaratskhelia is the Pope. He has a totally different attitude, a totally different personality."||Kvaratskhelia plays with a rugged urgency, socks around his ankles, calves exposed. He cavorts, he conjures. But against Milan on Sunday, without 21-goal forward Osimhen - a man Spalletti calls a "dragon with two heads" - he could not stop a vacant and disjointed Napoli sliding to a jarring 4-0 defeat.||Milan were supposed to graciously pass on the champions' baton. Instead they slapped down a reminder the upcoming Champions League quarter-final between the two - the first leg is on Wednesday - should not be taken for granted.||Neapolitans' relationship with their club is complex. Rather than the result, the fallout was about wider issues. Scuffles broke out between different sets of ultras in Curva B over how to protest against De Laurentiis' ticket prices and rules over which flags or banners they can bring into the ground.||"De Laurentiis has a really complicated relationship with the city because the supporters don't like the power, and he represented the power," explains Carignani.||"But we have to say that this victory is great for him because he is a great businessman, he put passion in the city but also his entrepreneurship view in managing the team and that has made the difference."||In the next few weeks, supporters and the board will both celebrate Napoli's first title in more than three decades. The fans have been asking the city's patron saint San Gennaro for this moment, they have called on the spirit of Maradona. Residents have been saving up in preparation for the mother of all celebrations. ||"We just feel this power, this emotion," says De Iesu. "It will be a great party all around the city, all the squares will be full of people."||"Now we are enjoying it," adds Carignani. "It was worth the wait."||Watch the full feature on what a first Scudetto in 33 years will mean to Naples on Football Focus on BBC One on Saturday, 15 April.|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.||The latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.||Analysis and opinion from our chief football writer.||How to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65193538
Gianluigi Lentini: The rise and fall of the world's most expensive player||He was a sensational player, Andreas Brehme. ||Most considered him the best left-back in world football - and Italia '90 saw the German at his peak. ||In the semi-final against England he had taken the free-kick which deflected up and over a flat-footed Peter Shilton, and he didn't waver during the ensuing penalty shootout success either. ||Having broken English hearts in Turin, Brehme decamped to Rome and rained on Diego Maradona's parade. ||In a West Germany team containing generational talents like Jrgen Klinsmann and Lothar Matthus, he was entrusted too with the decisive penalty against Argentina in the final.||Maradona's side, who ended the match with nine men, had cried foul. But when the dust settled, Brehme nervelessly despatched it. ||He was Andy Brehme, absolutely consummate, absolutely peerless...||Two and a half months later, on the third Sunday of the following Serie A season, Brehme, Klinsmann and Matthaus climbed aboard a bus in Milan. Italian football was replete with cash, their top three sides engaged in a footballing arms race. ||In Turin, Juventus had broken the bank to sign the hottest property in world football. Playmaker Roberto Baggio hadn't necessarily wanted to leave Florence, but Fiorentina president Flavio Pontello had been in no position to say no. ||AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi had acquired the Dutch triumvirate of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, and his Inter counterpart Ernesto Pellegrini had been compelled to act. ||Pellegrini had paid a king's ransom to acquire the German trio and built an uber-squad around them. Having won their opening two games, logic suggested they'd prevail against newly-promoted - and as yet winless - Torino. ||To celebrate their promotion, Toro president Gian Mauro Borsano had spent lavishly - in relative terms at least - on Spanish midfielder Rafael Martin Vasquez and they had also unearthed a promising young goalkeeper in Luca Marchegiani.||Beyond that, though, new coach Emiliano Mondonico had inherited a squad of misfits, journeymen and former youth team players. ||One of the youngsters was a coltish winger from Carmagnola, a pretty market town just south of Turin. ||The raw 21-year-old Gianluigi 'Gigi' Lentini had turned heads during the promotion campaign.||He ran and ran, had an eye for goal and was comfortable on either flank, with his right foot great and left passable.||Lentini seemed to have a myriad of ways to get past defenders. He could beat them with a trick, with pace - on the outside or inside - and always played with his head up. Physically he was developing into quite the specimen but, most of all, he was a footballing purist's dream. ||Italian football back then was highly strategic and fundamentally defensive - entertainment value was compromised by stolid pragmatism. ||Lentini wasn't much interested in that. Riotously talented and seemingly uncoached, he was a joyous antidote to the tactical rigidity and discipline of his nation's game.||The consensus around Turin was that he had a chance of making it, but Serie B was Serie B, and Serie A categorically was not. ||It was the wealthiest league in the world and the best players were queuing up to join the gravy train. With all due respect to the full-backs at Como, Catanzaro and Cosenza, players of Brehme's calibre were operating in a different footballing cosmos.||Or so it seemed. ||When the game kicked off, Toro were immediately around Inter. Mondonico's sides had always been more about urgency than method, but with Lentini front and centre, Inter found themselves penned in. ||They clung on for 45 goalless minutes, but Brehme - THE Andreas Brehme - was all at sea. When Lentini picked up a loose ball, ran 40 metres and despatched it past goalkeeper Walter Zenga to seal a 2-0 win, Brehme seemed almost concussed.||Humiliated...by a 21-year-old. Maybe Brehme wasn't as good as everyone thought. Or maybe Lentini was better than anyone dared hope.||With the success, Toro were up and running for the season and Lentini was the catalyst. ||In January they visited league leaders and, as it later transpired, champions-elect Sampdoria. In Roberto Mancini and Gianluca Vialli they had an outrageously talented front two, and Toro were decimated by injury.||The visitors produced a bus-parking masterclass, however, and Lentini dismantled Sampdoria on the break. ||He was essentially unplayable and another of the young guns, striker Giorgio Bresciani, was the chief beneficiary as his two goals propelled Toro to a famous win. The following month Lentini made his debut for the Italian national side.||In April, Toro won a first Turin derby in seven long years and qualification for the Uefa Cup was confirmed. Better still, abject rivals Juventus missed out on a European berth altogether. ||For 10 years either side of World War Two, Torino had been Italy's greatest sporting institution. That had ended abruptly and tragically in 1949 when the Superga Air Disaster saw the entire playing squad, coaching staff and board of directors of the Grande Torino wiped out at a stroke. ||An estimated million people attended the funeral, a city and nation in mourning. Someone was bound to fill the vacuum and Juventus, bankrolled by the Agnelli family and car manufacturer Fiat's millions, had done precisely that.||Toro had enjoyed fleeting success post-Superga, but somehow, and in some way, something always seemed to go wrong. They'd become a byword for misfortune, their trajectory the direct inverse of "lucky" Juve. They were much more popular locally but remained, figuratively as well as literally, Turin's poor relations. ||A building impresario who had made lots of money very quickly, Borsano aimed to change that and financed Torino's return to Serie A from his own pocket. Now, intoxicated with the club's fifth-placed finish in Serie A and his own burgeoning popularity, he went to the bank once more. ||Borsano was a small man with big political aspirations. There was a general election around the corner, and 'Il Presidente' made it known he would be standing. There were plenty of safe seats in and around left-leaning Turin, and the club's fanbase was comprised overwhelmingly from blue-collar, working-class voters. ||Election to Italy's lower house would grant Borsano immunity from any legal prosecution, but that fact didn't interest the tifosi much - certainly at the time. ||The economy was booming, money was cheap to borrow and Borsano borrowed big. Legend has it he called Mondonico in the summer of 1991 and told the coach he had bought him a present. When asked what it was, Borsano said it was Belgium's best footballer. ||Enzo Scifo was a midfielder of immense class and teaming him up with Martin Vasquez and Lentini was a mouth-watering prospect for the granata half of the city. ||Throw in the Brazilian goal poacher par excellence Walter Casagrande, and suddenly Toro - that's Toro - had well-founded aspirations of winning silverware. It was not quite the Grande Torino, but finally a team to be proud of. ||Berlusconi's Milan turned out to be untouchable in the 1991-92 season, but Toro improved once more, eventually finishing third and the established powers took note of their form - and then interest in their players. ||By now, there were unsettling rumours about Borsano's finances. But such tittle-tattle was the lifeblood of Italian football and he was bullish, saying Lentini - living his boyhood dream and contracted to June 1995 - wasn't for sale.||Besides, Borsano and his team had far more pressing matters at hand.||On 1 April 1992, Mondonico's side visited the Bernabeu for a Uefa Cup semi-final first leg, which Real Madrid came from behind to win 2-1. But the away goal augured well for the return.||Four days later, as Italy went to the polls, Torino walloped Juve in the derby once more. Borsano was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and those old enough to remember the Grande Torino held what was left of their breath for the return leg against Madrid.||Neither Torino nor Juventus, who both shared the unpopular Stadio Delle Alpi, had come close to filling its 69,000 seats. The visit of Real was different though. ||The people of Piedmont were reacquainted with the love of their club, and they sold it out quickly and gleefully.||Seven minutes in, Lentini delivered a wicked cross to the back post and Real's Brazilian centre-half Ricardo Rocha had no choice but to play it. He diverted it into his own net, unwittingly lighting the blue touchpaper. ||Chendo was Real's right-back that evening. An authentic club legend, he wasn't the most gifted, but few have been more popular or more redoubtable. ||However, with 13 minutes remaining and Real frantic for an away goal, Lentini had him right where he wanted. He ran at Chendo and, as the defender went to ground, skated beyond him and lifted his head to pick out Luca Fusi at the far post. Cue pandemonium. ||Toro's opponents in the final were Dennis Bergkamp's Ajax and Torino drew a breathless home leg 2-2.||But their characteristic misfortune saw them hit the woodwork three times in the Amsterdam return and somehow it finished 0-0, with the final lost on away goals. ||Toro fans added it to the list of near-misses, but what a journey it had been and Lentini maintained it was "the greatest regret of his professional career". ||In the aftermath of that defeat, the sand beneath Borsano's empire began to crumble. The numbers simply didn't add up and something had to give. That something, inevitably, would be the club's prized asset, with both Juventus' Giampiero Boniperti and AC Milan's Berlusconi waiting. ||Juventus was unconscionable, not least because anarchy would likely ensue in Turin. Some 25 years earlier, Juventus had been within hours of signing Gigi Meroni, another mercurial Toro winger. ||But when the news broke, Toro fans had gridlocked the city in protest and Juve president Gianni Agnelli had intervened to call that deal off. With an estimated 40,000 Toro fans on the payroll, the ramifications for Fiat - if Meroni had crossed to their rivals - didn't bear thinking about. ||Berlusconi took advantage. He whisked Lentini off to his villa in a helicopter and made him feel like his friend. He then informed the player he was being sold whether he liked it or not, due to an in-principle agreement he had signed with Borsano the previous year.||The deal was done for 13m, or 22m (65bn lire) if you factored in a stratospheric four-year contract. Lentini became the world's most expensive footballer and Borsano got his hands on 3.3m in under-the-counter cash. ||Baselessly, he accused Lentini of betraying the fans, claiming he had done all he could to keep him. It was nonsense, but the catholic, puritanical part of Italy screamed its opprobrium regardless. What madness was this that a footballing man-child might be worth that kind of money? Did these people have no shame?||Borsano would then offload local boys Bresciani, Roberto Cravero and Silvano Benedetti, along with Martin Vasquez and midfield enforcer Roberto Policano. ||With the backbone of their side ripped out in three desperate weeks, Toro fans took to the streets. Borsano was informed he would do well to make himself scarce as hundreds of ultras laid siege to the club offices. ||One fan famously - and apparently successfully - sued the club under Italy's equivalent of the Sale of Goods Act. He claimed his season ticket was no longer worth the paper it was printed on - and so it went. ||Borsano's business would implode dramatically and his political dalliances couldn't shield him from arrest and prosecution.||As their team bounced between Serie A and Serie B, Toro fans would spend the next 15 years picking up the tab. Same old, same old||And Lentini? He performed pretty well in his first season at Milan, but not extravagantly so. It was a team that contained four or five great players and it transpired he was merely a very good one. ||Lentini was anonymous when Milan lost an insipid Champions League Final to Marseille in 1993, and when Italy's football media went looking for scapegoats, Lentini's price tag preceded him.  ||At Toro, his long hair, earring and fondness for holidays in Ibiza had endeared him to the great unwashed. 'Gigi' was a simple kid from the provinces, they'd told themselves, and it was reflected in the abandon with which he played his football. Now they concluded his provincialismo wasn't a natural fit for a global 'brand' like AC Milan. ||Lentini was supposed to be urbane and cosmopolitan, but urbane and cosmopolitan were all the things he wasn't. He was a young guy from Carmagnola who had become insanely rich in an instant - and liked doing the sort of things that young guys from Carmagnola liked to do. ||His nocturnal comings and goings were becoming a story and it would all come to a head - in the most dramatic circumstances imaginable - later that summer||By now Lentini was in a relationship with Rita Bonaccorso, the wife of the Juve striker Salvatore 'Tot' Schillaci. ||Schillaci had been the break-out star of Italia '90 but now his marriage, much like his career, was in terminal decline. Bonaccorso and Schillaci were engaged in a tit-for-tat game of betrayal, with Lentini cast as the man in the middle. ||Following a pre-season tournament in Genoa, he climbed into his canary-yellow Porsche 911.||Bonaccorso was waiting impatiently in Turin and so he launched the car at breakneck speed along the A21 motorway. He got a puncture, pulled into a service station and watched, frustrated, as an attendant bolted on the spare. ||Lentini roared back onto the road, but failed to understand that the skinnier wheel wasn't designed to exceed 50mph, let alone the 125mph he was purported to have been doing. ||A following truck driver watched on in horror as the car began to zigzag wildly across the carriageway. He leaped out of his cab to drag Lentini from the wreckage seconds before it caught fire. ||He was put in an induced coma, but the Lentini who emerged was a shadow of the buccaneering footballer he had been. Save for a highly productive five-week period in early 1995, he hardly played for three seasons and scored precisely six league goals. Some speculated the coma had impacted his balance, others said his cognitive skills were diminished. ||That's probably true to some degree at least, but he was lucid enough when he married a beautiful Swedish model. Typical of this most untypical of footballers, he tied the knot in his old parish church in Carmagnola. There were no journalists and hardly anyone from his footballing career received an invite. ||As his form and fitness deteriorated, the line went that, for all that Lentini liked playing football, he'd never really embraced it as a job. That maverick streak had been the perfect fit for Toro, where Mondonico's promptings and the "new Gigi Meroni" schtick had suited just about everybody. ||In Milan, however, they demanded professional rigour. ||The club retained a psychologist, and measured the players' reaction time and physical parameters. They sought to quantify performance, deploying objective data to assess subjective performance. ||It was a far cry from Mondonico's muck-and-nettles approach and the latitude Lentini had been given in Turin. ||The story went that he liked the discotheque much more than the training ground, and the affair with Bonaccorso and his car crash were symptoms of a deeper malaise. Lentini was ill-suited to football's modern, more professional era, When his contract expired, Milan couldn't wait to get him off the books. ||By now Mondonico was working down the road in Bergamo, coaching Atalanta. He offered a way out and, under him, Lentini became something like the player he'd been at Toro. ||He was still only 27 when Arrigo Sacchi recalled him to the Italy team in November 1996, and hope sprang eternal. Yet at the season's end, Lentini saw fit to rejoin Serie B Toro. ||That finished him as an international footballer, but signalled the start of a nomadic, rackety coda to his career.||After a promotion and immediate relegation with Torino, Lentini hitched another ride alongside Mondonico at Serie B Cosenza.||Mondonico, he said, was the only coach capable of making him angry on a football pitch and, as the son of a Sicilian migrant family, he felt the pull of the south. Besides, the weather down there suited him too.||When asked whether he, less than a decade after becoming the world's most expensive footballer, felt chastened by playing in front of 3,000 fans in a footballing backwater, Lentini seemed genuinely nonplussed. ||Football was football, he replied, regardless of where you played and who it was against. When Cosenza were demoted to Serie D for financial irregularities in 2004, Lentini stayed on. He did so because they asked him to - and because they were nice people.||He went home to Piedmont in 2004 and, aged 35, an old friend asked him to turn out for local amateur team Canelli. ||On the way to training one evening he called in on Diego Fuser, another graduate of the Toro school of excellence. As professionals they'd gone their separate ways and hadn't played together for 15 years. ||Fuser hadn't been as gifted as Lentini, but few had. Instead he had enjoyed success with AC Milan, Lazio, Parma and Roma, as well as representing Italy 25 times. Their friendship, formed when they were starry-eyed teenagers, had endured.||Fuser's eight-year-old son was suffering from an incurable illness and the camaraderie acted as a balm of sorts. Fuser, too, was reminded that football's greatest virtue is that it's only a game, and the two of them set to work once more. ||Canelli earned promotion to semi-professional Serie D in 2006, and Lentini and Fuser carried on playing together in the lower leagues beyond their 40th birthdays.  ||Lentini, now 54, still lives in Carmagnola and plays billiards - his great passion - with the people he grew up with, and recently tried his hand at beekeeping. ||He opened a honey shop, but that was probably wishful thinking even by his standards and it has closed down now.||The latest story about him in the Italian press involved 100,000 euros being given to a local organised crime boss. Lentini never denied handing over the money, but claimed it was a loan. The recipient was found not guilty of extortion, but the affair highlighted Lentini's apparent naivety.||His vagaries still fascinate. Some say he betrayed his talent, others that he was the victim of it. They will tell you he was the flotsam and jetsam of a sport which was becoming unmoored from reality. Hijacked by people like Borsano and monetized by Berlusconi and the others, it had detached from the everyday life of its communities. ||The Italian game was being transformed into a tawdry consumable, which may explain why it is in such a parlous state these days. ||Qualitatively it's a shadow of its former self - and its empty stadiums tell their own story.||Many point to Lentini's rise and fall as the turning point, the beginning of a race to the bottom. That's perhaps overly dramatic. He was not for one minute its architect. It's just that, as metaphors go, he and his career arc are just about perfect.||What a player he was though. What a sight to see. ||Just ask Andreas Brehme.|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/65116702
The unlikely rise of Gaelic football on the fields of Cambodia||Sovann ThidaAva has never met her parents. ||Born in the mid-2000s, she was found abandoned as a baby on the street in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. ||She was taken in by a local non-governmental organisation (NGO) for disadvantaged children, where she was raised.||"I have no idea where my mum went," says ThidaAva, who goes by the name Ava.||Life in care was crowded and chaotic, but over the years she built up a close bond with the other girls there. ||"We were like sisters because we grew up together we lived together in one group," she says. ||During playtime, the boys played football and volleyball, but the girls were not encouraged to join in. ||"The girls were encouraged to do dancing and art," Ava says.||Despite being around large groups her entire life, Ava knew little beyond the walls of the organisation. ||That all changed in 2018, when somebody offered to take her to a training session for a sport she'd never heard of - Gaelic football - at a club that was barely a year old.||Cairde Khmer external-linkhad been formed in 2017 by two Irishmen - Conor Wall and Paddy Campbell. ||"It was meant to be a bit of craic - go to Bangkok one time to check out a Gaelic tournament," says Ronan Sheehan, the club's chairman.||The trip to Bangkok was a success and the decision was made to keep the club going. ||To begin with, Cairde Khmer was made up almost completely of Westerners. But in 2018, the club started seeing a small influx of Cambodian players turning up to training. ||Ava started playing around then, despite only being about 13. She initially found the rules confusing but soon became one of the team's best and most fearless players. ||"She is absolutely vicious," Sheehan says. "Her tackling can be quite rough. I used to take great delight watching grown women in their 20s and 30s asking the referee to protect them from this rampaging 14-year-old.||"Referees are always coming up to us and telling us she has to calm down. But we can't calm that out of her because it's a big part of her game. She plays it right on the edge."||Soon a trickle of Cambodian players became a steady stream, as word started to spread. ||Vat Sreypov joined the team in 2019. As a child, Sreypov had always longed to play sports like the boys in her village, but was never given the chance. ||"I was not allowed to play football because my brother said it was not for women," Sreypov recalls. "Most women are not encouraged to play football in Cambodia. There are so many norms about women and how to behave - you are told not to walk fast and you should not be heard when you walk."||Cairde Khmer was a breath of fresh air to her. ||The men's team was also attracting new local talent, including Touch Phanouch. ||Phanouch was born in 2000 near one of the world's most notorious rubbish dumps, Stung Meanchey,external-link on the outskirts of the capital. His parents struggled to make ends meet and Phanouch was sent to a local NGO, where he got access to education and sport.||He developed a passion for sport and in his teenage years was introduced to Australian rules football. Through this he found Gaelic football - a common route for many of the squad - and fell in love.||"The beauty is that it gets me to wake up my brain when I play because it's a mix of rules," he says, drawing some parallels with Australian rules football and soccer. ||Soon, about 90% of the Cairde Khmer ranks were Cambodian. This contrasts with most Gaelic football teams in Asia, which are predominantly or fully made up of Irish nationals.||"I go down to the training on a Monday night and you can have anything close to 45-50 Cambodian players down there," says Sheehan, who has worked as an English language teacher in Phnom Penh for eight years.||"I'm walking into that and knowing they're not language students or anything like that, they're there to kick a leather ball around a field - something my brothers and sisters and my father were doing growing up in Ireland. ||"Seeing it unfold before your eyes here, it still really blows my mind." ||It didn't take long for Cairde Khmer to start making waves in the region. ||In 2019, the men won both the Asian Gaelic Games and South Asian Gaelic Games in the junior category, while the women reached the final of the latter tournament.||Last year, both teams, with Cambodian players now easily outnumbering their Irish ex-pat team-mates, were runners-up at the 2022 Asian Gaelic Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ||The women caused an upset against a strong Thai side in the semi-final, scoring a goal in the dying seconds. ||"The referee blew the whistle and I dropped to my knees and started bawling my eyes out crying," Sheehan says. "I've never felt anything like that on any field."||Off the back of those performances, Cairde Khmer were invited to the GAA World Games in Derry, Northern Ireland, in July. The club are raising funds for the trip.||"It's like going to play the World Cup in England," says Phanouch, who often watches Irish Gaelic football matches on YouTube.||"We will be meeting the real people in Gaelic sport, getting a real authentic experience - talking to legends and superstars in the sport, the Lionel Messi's of Gaelic football. I cannot wait to talk and learn more about the sport and its origins." ||Phanouch says Gaelic football is giving many of the team the chance to travel the world in ways that would never have been possible before. ||"It gives them a lifetime experience - some of them would not have been able to go abroad. ||"They would not have a chance to visit Thailand, Malaysia or Vietnam," Phanouch says, let alone Ireland.||Phanouch recently graduated from university and is working in business development at a sports resort in Thailand. He credits Cairde Khmer with helping broaden his horizons. ||"Even me, I would never have thought about going abroad or making money," he says. "But it taught us to go out and learn more about the world. This is what this sport has taught us." ||Despite being discouraged from playing football as a child, Sreypov says her family are now impressed by her achievements in the Gaelic form of the sport. ||"With Cambodian parents, if the kid can get to travel to another country, they are already proud. They don't say anything about me playing football any more," she says, adding that she has introduced the game to her boyfriend.||Ava is regularly the top scorer at tournaments and is eagerly looking forward to the prospect of playing in the home of Gaelic football later this year. ||But the sport has given her a lot more than accolades on the field. ||"The positive part is meeting new people outside," she says. "It makes me feel more relaxed and light. It makes me feel less lonely."|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/gaelic-games/65064562

Nazare: Love and pain on the world's biggest wave||As he looks out from his balcony, over slumped, drying wetsuits, Andrew Cotton can see it all.||The stretch of sand, the salt haze, a spike of cliff and a scarlet lighthouse.||Most of all, Cotton can see Nazare's waves. They are small today, relatively at least, but there is still a backdrop of bubbling white water and churning white noise.||When the swell is right and the surf is up, it is a different story on a different scale. ||Nazare, a small town 60 miles north of Lisbon, is where towering waves - some the height of 10-storey buildings - crash to shore.||For generations of local fishermen, those conditions have meant danger and death. For Cotton they are a way of life and a living.||"Weirdly, somehow, I have turned it into a job, so when it is big, you go out there," he says. ||"You go out there all day and do what you need to do."||When it is one of those days, Cotton doesn't need to even look. When the biggest, most lucrative wave in the world arrives, he knows as soon as he wakes, before his eyes open.||"Living here, I know how big the waves are by how much the windows are rattling," he adds.||"It can really be something else, you know? The ocean can be scary when there are no waves. When here is big it can be petrifying."||Nazare's wave has several beginnings.||One is 130 miles out, three miles down and millions of years back in the quiet cold of the Atlantic. ||From there a deep, underwater canyon formed, snaking into the Portuguese coast. It climbs steeply just off the shore at Nazare and, when the conditions align, it funnels a mass of water up into freakish moving mountains.||Another is 14 September 1152. That day legend says a local hunter was saved from falling over a cliff edge and into the wild ocean below by a holy vision, forever linking Nazare with heaven, hell and high water in the Portuguese imagination.||For Cotton and other big-wave surfers the beginning of Nazare's waves is more modern and less dramatic. It was an email sent by Dino Casimiro in 2005.||As a child, Casimiro, the son of a fisherman, would steal box lids as local women packed the catch and use them to catch waves instead.||"They told me that I will die," he says of his family's reaction to his taking his makeshift bodyboard to Praia do Norte, the beach where the biggest waves break.||"They saw the waves like a devil. In Nazare we have a relationship of love and hate with the ocean. Love because it gives us the food and the tourists and hate because it also takes the lives of our relatives."||Casimiro persevered, but some days the waves and the doubts were too big. ||"We would sit on the sand looking at perfect, massive waves with no-one on them because we didn't have the confidence, skill and equipment to ride them," he adds.||However, Casimiro knew some people who might.||Tow-in surfing, where surfers take turns to drag each other on to waves via a jet-ski, had been pioneered in Hawaii a decade before, allowing the brave to ride otherwise unreachable, fast-moving monsters.||When his local wave was at its wildest, Casimiro took a picture, plugged his camera into his computer and went surfing online instead.||"I searched for the most-known surfers in tow and big-wave surfing, but it was 2005," says Casimiro.||"Now everyone has Instagram and Facebook. Then it wasn't easy, but Garrett already had his own website and in the corner was a 'contact me' button."||A female voice crackles over the radio.||"You have three giant waves coming."||The jet ski, driven by Cotton, peels away and up the steepening face of the wave. The surf board, ridden by Garrett McNamara, heads in the opposite direction; down past the point of no return.||The angle isn't perfect.||"I wanted to be a lot deeper entering that wave," says McNamara.||"I was holding that rope until the last second. It made me go all the way to the bottom of the wave, turning off as hard as I could.||"As I looked back out to sea, the whole horizon had gone black."||It was 1 November 2011; six years after Casimiro's first email to McNamara, one year since McNamara stood on Nazare's lighthouse, declaring he had found his Holy Grail and 15 seconds into the biggest wave ever surfed.||The footage is both absorbing and disorientating. ||McNamara hurtles downwards, but only seems to creep towards the wave's bottom, as it swells almost as fast as he can ride it.||He is being carried towards the camera, but the perspective is out of sync. McNamara appears to shrink, rather than grow, as the crest surges skywards behind him.||And all the time, tonnes of water teeter over him, hanging only by the thin, white thread weaved by his board down the face of the wave.||"You don't hear the wave," adds McNamara. "You are going so fast all you can hear is the wind rushing past your ears.||"You are not really thinking either. You are in the flow state, following your heart.||"It's exhilarating. It is like driving a car under an avalanche, but you are taunting the avalanche rather than trying to get away from it."||As the spray settled, the ripples from his feat travelled fast.||A couple of days later, surfing legend Kelly Slater tweeted to describe what he had been forwarded. external-link||"I just saw a shot of Garrett McNamara from Portugal on a stupidly big wave. He should post that thing ASAP."||A week later, he did. The footage was first released to ESPN, giving a primetime United States audience first sight of their fellow American. By the next morning, it led bulletins in Portugal and soon, it was everywhere.||"It went bonkers," remembers McNamara. "Bananas! The media storm we had to endure after the ride was far bigger than the wave."||The wave was clocked at 78 feet (24 metres) high, a world record. As interview requests came from round the globe, McNamara spent the next three weeks repeating his story, and that of Nazare's waves, to television presenters, radio hosts and newspaper reporters.||It was a triumph for him, but also for a unique bit of town planning.||Casimiro's hunch that Nazare's waters could deliver more than fish and summer tourists had found support in city hall.||"We didn't have a huge budget and we realised that doing something with big waves will save us 20 to 30 years of promotion," explains Pedro Pisco, part of a small municipal team, alongside Casimiro, who banked on conquering Praia do Norte's waves.||Together they recruited the small band of surfers, supplied equipment and came up with a strategy to sell their small town to the world. ||The rest of Nazare had thought it a bad bet.  ||"At the beginning, nobody believed in us. Not one person," says Casimiro.||"It was really tough. Everyone mocked us. They said we were wasting our time on Praia do Norte. No sponsors believed in us."||Initially, after McNamara's arrival in Nazare, the sceptics had seemed right too. ||The jet-skis were underpowered. Their engines would flood or choke out on stray plastic bags, leaving rider and surfer bobbing perilously in the path of oncoming waves. ||Even when they were working, Englishman Cotton admits he, as driver, was under-skilled. ||"I wasn't up to scratch, I just blagged it really," he says of his turns in control of the motor.||The day before the world record had been another failure; a broken jet-ski and an injury for Cotton.||They weren't even going to venture out the following morning. But then conditions changed, McNamara, Cotton and their Northern Irish team-mate Al Mennie changed their mind and, together, they caught the wave that changed everything.||"When you let go of the rope, there is a feeling of being alone," says Justine Dupont.||"The wave is still forming right under your feet, coming up from the ocean floor. It is like you are going up in a lift.||"Then you are going faster and faster and you feel like you are using 100% of all your senses and your potential as a human, like you are activating your superhero mode.||"You are just living the moment, nothing else exists apart from that moment."||Dupont had seen video of McNamara's world record wave. She had seen the viral photo of another terrifying break he had ridden a little over a year later.||But, when she first arrived in Nazare in 2016 with her partner, fellow surfer and sometime jet-ski driver Fred David, those images intimidated as much as inspired.||"I was super nervous and impressed by the footage," she says.||"We went in the water, the waves weren't that big and Fred told me, 'come on, if you are scared of this size, we are going to have trouble staying here!'||"But I managed to win against my fear."||She has done more than that. Dupont, 31, is now one of the best big-wave surfers anywhere. Few of Nazare's waves have been ridden as well, or captured as thrillingly, as one she caught in February 2020.external-link||But the fear remains. It has to. The danger is too clear, the reminders too recent.||In January this year, luck ran out. Brazilian Marcio Freire, a 47-year-old veteran of the big-wave world, became the first surfer to die on Praia do Norte.external-link||Dupont is reconciled to that risk. She recognises that every time she enters the water, she may not return.||"It is crazy, you feel so free on the wave when everything is good, you feel super alive, but when something goes wrong you think, 'OK, I may die'," she says.||"There is a little moment where you question what is going to happen.||"There is a suspense about how the wave will hit you, and then, under the water, it is super violent.||"You have to be comfortable with the good things you have done in life."||Cotton's outlook is a similar mix of faith and fatalism, tested by experience.||In 2017, he was towed on to a wave by McNamara, misjudged a line slightly and was spat out. His body was tossed 20 feet out of the breaking wave and into the air. When he landed back on the water's surface, the impact broke his back. He returned to surfing in Nazare within a year. external-link||"You can't play it safe, there is no point in going out there with that mindset," he says.||"The wipeouts and falls hurt, but they are part of it. You can't blow the whistle or call time-out out there, the waves don't stop. ||"You either learn to enjoy it or just don't do it.||"At some points you think, this could be it, but one good skill I have is I can switch off. In that situation, I think about absolutely nothing, almost resign myself to being dead.||"When you do that it is amazing how much the body can take, how long you can hold your breath for, how powerful the mind is.||"But as soon as you panic and your heartbeat goes high, that 30 seconds underwater can feel like a minute. It gets dangerous."||In a sport that is usually solitary, those stakes strain the partnership between surfer and driver.||"When the waves get that big, it is a team sport. Everyone has to be a player and it has to be less about you, more about the team," says Cotton.||"You might be having the best surf but then you jump on the jet-ski and you can't get your mate any waves. It can be frustrating, you can have arguments, sometimes you leave feeling guilty.||"It can be like a marriage, you have ups and downs and good days and bad days."||For Dupont, the parallels between personal and the professional are apt.||"It is tricky as a couple for sure," she says of working alongside her partner.||"I know he is going to do his best for me, but we got to a point when we felt the risk and Fred had a hard time putting me on a big, big wave.||"So during the big days now, I have started working with [Brazilian surfer] Lucas Chumbo. I respect him and I don't argue with him. With Fred, I respect him, but sometimes I need to speak!||"At the start in Nazare it was good because Fred and I could surf a lot and improve fast. But when you are on the line-up on big days, in stormy conditions, you really feel the risks. You think 'what are we doing here, this isn't smart, we should go back home, we love each other and we have a good life'."||If putting your partner in harm's way is hard, being out of town and out the loop is perhaps worse.||On big days at Nazare, Fred is still there in the water. Only now he works on the safety jet-ski, tasked with recovering Dupont at the end of her ride, rather than launching her on to it.||McNamara's wife Nicole has made a similar choice, getting involved, rather than attempting to ignore the risk. ||Standing on the lighthouse, she spotted the fateful world record wave in 2011 on the horizon and radioed it in for McNamara, Cotton and Mennie to line up. ||A year later, she and Garrett were married in a ceremony on the same spot. The second of their three children bears Nazare as a middle name.||The town is part of the fabric of their family life. It has been a defining staging post in Dupont and Cotton's careers. But all three have made Nazare's name, just as much as Nazare has made theirs.||The local paper - Regiao da Nazare - didn't give McNamara's arrival much space back in December 2010. ||A story covering the Hawaiian's press conference, alongside Nazare's then-mayor Jorge Barroso, took up barely a third of page 12.||Much more prominent, less than four months before, was a special report headlined "Professions on the verge of extinction".||Below, was a picture of Jose Manuel Rebelo, a basket weaver. Cobbler Jose Maria Eusebio clutched a pair of sandals in another image. Dressmaker Ana Emilia Amada Curado Louracio looking up into the lens from her sewing machine.||The article lamented the decline of traditional industries in a town of terracotta roofs and polished cobbles. It guessed fearfully at what the future might hold. ||It never foresaw what a big swell now brings to Nazare.||Food trucks and merchandise hawkers line the road down to the lighthouse as busloads of people, mostly young, scramble for a vantage point.||Thousands line the cliffs and video drones hum through the air as jet-skis and surfers take on mammoth sets of waves below.||Nazare is, after some initial opposition from the other side of the Atlantic, indisputably the biggest wave in the world. ||The world record for the biggest wave surfed has been broken twice since McNamara in 2011, both occasions were in Nazare. ||Germany's Sebastian Steudtner is the current holder after a wave he rode in October 2020 was officially measured at 86 feet (26 metres).||France's Dupont and Brazilian Maya Gabeira have fought over the women's best mark, but whoever owns it, it too belongs to Nazare.||As well as being the world biggest wave, Nazare is also one of the most accessible.||Cortes Bank - one of Nazare's nearest rivals - breaks 100 miles off the Californian coast and comes alive only for a few days a year.||By contrast, Nazare is a 90-minute drive from an international airport and breaks so close to the shore spectators above can hear the surfers' shouts below in an almost stadium-like setting. ||The lighthouse, which once warned fisherman away from the rocks, is a fixture in mesmerising online footage, luring people to Nazare.||It now houses a surfing museum, with tickets costing two euros each. It welcomed 371,391 visitors last year, almost five times the number who attended in 2015, its first full year of opening.||One report claimed the number of tourists to the town had trebled in the decade since 2010.external-link||Estate agents windows gleam with market-fresh properties and promises they can do business in a number of languages. ||"It is crazy," says Dupont. She and her partner now live a 15-minute drive inland in a quiet, pine-shaded home, away from Nazare's bustle.||"In 2016, we could drive to the lighthouse and there might be two people there. Now there are so many people, the road is closed, there is almost no access for us surfers to check the wave.||"I used to go with my sponsors beanie, now I kind of hide it because I don't want people to stop me and ask 100 questions.||"They are super nice but it has changed a lot - and for good I think."||The influx has certainly brought more money to the town. Businesses that previously survived from summer to summer, now continue to cash in through the winter's big-wave season.||Some locals don't see the same benefits. Nazare's cobblers, dressmakers and basket-weavers won't find many sales among the surf crowd.||Like on shore, the dividends for those in the water are shared unevenly.||There are a few big-wave surfing competitions. Dupont picked up $9000 (7,300) cheque for the best female performance at Nazare's biggest last year, but sponsors provide the real windfall. ||Before 2011, McNamara was backed by some low-key Brazilian surf equipment manufacturers. "None of the cool companies," as he puts it.||After Nazare's carefully-coordinated publicity blitz for his world record, blue-chip brands got on McNamara's board by the boat-load.||In addition to a raft of new surf sponsors, he has represented a high-end German car company, a Swiss watchmaker and a Swedish bike rack manufacturer.||Such endorsements depend on exposure and getting it involves playing the game as well as pursuing your sport.||"There are so many big waves ridden each year," explains Cotton. "You get the biggest swell of the year and the media make out there is only one wave in it. One person gets chosen and it not always the right person or the right wave.||"It can be about a brand marketing their athlete or an agency getting their photos out that is it."||Measuring surging, moving waves is an inexact and time-consuming science.  Steudtner's world record wave was only officially measured and ratified 18 months after he had surfed it.||Hype fills the gap.||"Two or three times a year, there will be press releases," says Cotton. ||"I read one recently saying a 115-foot wave had been surfed here. Another said a 101-foot wave. Another was 98 foot. People just make up numbers, get a scientist to say something and you know what? It is great for big-wave surfing, the town, and the sport."||In this big-wave boom town, the stats may not always be what they seem. ||But the stakes and the surf dwarf everywhere else. || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/surfing/65056499

How a New York gang truce spawned an Olympic sport||The introduction of breaking into the Olympics for Paris 2024 may have surprised many, but for Michael Holman - writer, producer, artist, entrepreneur and self-dubbed hip-hop pioneer - it was the realisation of a 40-year vision. ||The Games' website describes breaking as a "hip-hop" style of dance characterised by 'acrobatic movement and stylized footwork'. ||The format is fundamentally different to ice dancing or gymnastics though. Athletes don't wait their turn to perform one-by-one and impress judges. ||Instead breakers will take to the floor in pairs in Paris, "battling" head-to-head and upping each other's moves to take home a medal.  ||Back in the early 1980s, Holman ran a weekly hip-hop revue in a downtown Manhattan club which combined rap and graffiti with the new form of street dance. ||At first, it was about performance. The breakers would dance, the audience would applaud, the evening would move on and the next act would appear.||But Holman insisted on adding one more element to his booming club night.||"New York is all about competition and about trying to be the best," he said. "And I wanted to bring another crew along to battle. I want the audience to see a battle, not just moves."||It's what Holman had witnessed months earlier on the streets of the Bronx. There, breaking had emerged as a form of dance combat, springing from a shift in the gang tensions that had blighted 1970s New York.  ||"There were the Ghetto Brothers and the Black Spades, the Savage Nomads, and the Savage Skulls. And they'd been bloodletting for years: breaking heads, killing, stabbing each other," he said. ||"Then, in 1971, Yellow Benjy - the leader of the Ghetto Brothers - forced a truce that allowed the guys and gals from rival gangs to get together and party."||It was at these parties, where dance replaced violence as an outlet for neighbourhood bravado, that the city's many cultures cultivated breaking's creativity. ||Holman continued: "Breakers would watch other breakers saying: 'Wow, that's wild. The way you're bringing in Kung Fu moves from the Chinese community. I'm gonna incorporate your Kung Fu and put it with my African cakewalk dance, or incorporate it with a Puerto Rican gymnastics aesthetic.'  And all this while dancing to old James Brown records mixed on Jamaican-style sound systems. That's the culture of b-boy dance."||The first band of breakers resident at Holman's nights were a group he informally managed called the "Rock Steady Crew". Initially, they were loathed to share a stage with a rival outfit, but eventually they relented to Holman's requests.||"I brought down a crew called the 'Floor Masters' and boom, it was like a historic moment," said Holman. "The 'Floor Masters' were much more about athleticism and speed and power, and when I saw them battle, I dropped the 'Rock Steady Crew' like a hot potato."||Holman helped form and then manage a new breaking crew that would focus solely on the 'power' moves he'd witnessed from the 'Floor Masters'. ||They recruited the best dancers from the best crews across the city's five boroughs and named the new group the 'New York City Breakers'. It featured some of the art form's best exponents: Noel 'Kid Nice' Manguel, Matthew 'Glide Master' Caban, and Tony 'Powerful Pexster' Lopez. ||Together, they took breaking to an all-new level of skill. ||"I got rid of the weak dancers and raided three or four other crews from the city. I created a super crew of power breaking," said Holman.||"The Breakers were able to like, gyroscope. They'd start out doing footwork and then go down to the ground and, using some sort of internal propulsion, mixed with the friction of the ground, simultaneously ball themselves up in a certain way or spread out in a certain way, they'd create an internal energy. ||"They were able to spin and do these flares. They figured out a new way to move, and it was pure poetry."||Holman first arrived in New York from San Francisco in 1978. Though working at a bank on Wall Street, "wearing Brookes Brothers suits each day", he quickly fell in love with the grittier culture of the city he called home.  ||"I was living in a loft apartment on Hudson [Street] and Chambers [Street]," he said. "I'd get the elevator down in the morning and I'd see Joey Ramone [lead singer of iconic punk band The Ramones] - coming in from an all-night party with a girl on each arm. It was crazy." ||Holman soon became part of the scene himself, becoming friends with pioneering graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy and frequenting night spots like Max's Kansas City, Mudd Club and CBGBs; venues that allowed him to mix with musicians, poets and other up-and-coming artists. ||"I was eating-in New York like ice cream," Holman said, wistfully, recalling that he was on his way back from a late-night party of his own when he saw the first signs of a new street culture emerging around him. ||"I was half asleep waiting for a subway. And then this train comes into the station and it's covered, top-to-bottom, across all the windows with graffiti logos and burners [large, elaborate designs in spray paint]. And I'd never seen anything like it before, it was an insane message from the street. It was vandalism, but beautiful at the same time.||"Young kids saying: 'Look at me. Look what I can do. I'm not a nobody. OK, so this city houses the United Nations, it's the capital of media and finance but I'm a kid from the Bronx, and I've got game, too!'" ||For Holman, this ethos was also behind hip-hop's emergence and breakers' compulsion to express themselves through dance.||"It's about, look at me, I'm somebody," he said. "I can take a microphone and write my own poetry, I can cut and scratch a turntable, I can rock the floor like a b-boy, I can pull off head spins like you can't even imagine.||"Kids were creating their own universe with nothing more than two turntables, a mic and a piece of linoleum."||As Holman made music, shot films and soaked up New York's energy, he wondered if the city's small hip-hop and breaking scene could become a break-out trend, just like punk which had sprung up in London and New York in the previous decade.||"A friend of mine went to school with Malcolm McLaren back in the 1960s," said Holman. ||"When McLaren visited New York, I invited him to a block party in the Bronx with Afrika Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay. I took him to a park jam, where the DJs had their sound systems and where the b-boys and b-girls went to dance.||"Malcolm was blown away and so he asks me to put together a review. Well, I did that."||McLaren had a good instinct for revolutionary cultural movements. He had managed the Sex Pistols, who became punk figureheads after releasing their anti-monarchist single 'God Save the Queen' to coincide with Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee in 1977.||He connected Holman with an English-born promoter in the city called Ruza 'Kool Lady' Blue who had a regular night at the Jamaican-owned Negril nightclub.||And by November 1981, the nightspot was rocking to Holman's DJ friends and the The Rock Steady Crew breakers. ||Once word got around about the hip-hop nights, a newly-formed super-troupe and their amazing displays of breaking on show at Holman's Negril nights, the New York media started to take notice too.||"Well, what we were doing became the flavour of the month for these international broadcast companies," he said. "You've got documentary crews from all over the world in New York: the BBC, Canal Plus, NHK, Rai TV and ZDF.||"They go film the Breakers, package it up and send it back to wherever they're from. And it goes on the news that night. So you got kids in London and Tokyo and Paris exposed to hip-hop culture before even the kids in Pittsburgh were."||Holman decided to make some content of his own. He created and presented the TV show Graffiti Rock in 1984, a hip-hop-dedicated music show along the lines of the successful Soul Train, which featured Run-DMC, Kool Moe Dee and Special K, along with the New York City Breakers. ||"It was the first hip-hop TV show in the world," said Holman. ||The New York City Breakers also crossed over into Middle America's mainstream. They appeared on the Merv Griffin Show - a popular American talk show - the CBS Evening News, Good Morning America and Soul Train itself. They featured in a music video, pulling moves while soul legend Gladys Knight sang Save the Overtime (For Me). ||The last major event Holman booked for the New York City Breakers was at the London Contemporary Dance Trust in 1987. ||"By then the gigs were dying out. It was seen as a passing fad. The media had moved on and the breakers were starting to go their different ways," he said.||But elsewhere, the party went on.||"As with a lot of cultural movements that start in America, like jazz, rock 'n' roll and blues; they die out here only to find a new life and a new identity overseas. Same happened with breaking," Holman added. ||By the late 1990s, Holman was getting invites to hip-hop conventions all over the world, with interest in Australia, Asia, Europe and South America.||He hosted panels and lectures about the breaking movement, watched breaking films and took part in dance workshops where the original dancers had been asked to make an appearance. ||One young Polish dance crew even made a point of showing him they'd learned a routine from Graffiti Rock, move for move. But not all breakers were as welcoming. ||"I used to get a lot of screwy looks from some of the breakers when I showed up," said Holman. ||"They would say: 'Oh, you're the one trying to push this as a sport, trying to kill the art form.' ||"But I always felt the movement had a mind and life of its own. The culture itself is sentient. Hip-hop is now collectively a multi-billion dollar industry that's impacted the world. ||"There were the same debates about skateboarding and extreme sports. There was outcry at the thought of an art form being 'judged', with points and scoring. I'm sure figure skating was the same in the 1930s.||"But just consider the fact that this is a movement created in New York City; the capital of commerce, the belly of the capitalism beast. To question its path toward competition and commercialisation is naive at best."||Debate aside, breaking's remarkable battle the from Bronx's sidewalks to the Olympic stage is gratifying for Holman, one of the few who grasped the potential of its power-moves and poetry more than four decades ago.  || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/olympics/64987866
Isles of Scilly: Runaway cows and visits from Beckham - life in the world's littlest league||When Anthony Gibbons joined a Sunday morning kickabout, he didn't imagine it would lead to being David Beckham's body double. ||But it turns out playing in the world's smallest league is a less predictable experience than it first appears.||The Isles of Scilly Football League consists of just two teams - the Woolpack Wanderers and Garrison Gunners. Not only do the sides face off in 18 league games each season, but they also compete in two annual cup competitions - both two-legged affairs with no away goals rule - and a Charity Shield-style exhibition. ||The duopoly makes it the smallest league of its kind in the world. Technically it is an intra-club league, because both teams are registered to St Mary's, a club on the eponymously-titled island in the archipelago off the Cornish coast.||That footnote hasn't stopped global attention and a slew of star visitors though, including the day Beckham swapped Los Angeles Galaxy for the remoteness of the isles, and Gibbons swapped in to fill the former England captain's boots.||"That's my claim to fame," says Gibbons.||But being part of a uniquely familiar rivalry runs it close.||It didn't used to be like this. Before the 1950s, there were four teams vying for glory and silverware.||But an ageing, dwindling population has put the league under pressure. Between 2011 and 2021, the number of people on the Isles of Scilly fell by 6.8%.external-link The median age of those remaining rose from 46 to 50 years old over the same period.||Now, only the Wanderers and Gunners remain.||Weather permitting, the two sides do battle every Sunday morning between October and Easter on the same pitch with the same players in the same kit.||"It's considered to be a bit ridiculous and like the old cliche of 'can we play you every week?'," explains Will Lethbridge, who grew up on the islands and has played in the league for several years.||"People ask if it gets a bit boring and if it's repetitive, but it's good to have a run around and it's good fun. A large number of us are friends and have known each other since school, so it's very much the social side as much as a bit of sporting competition. ||"You do know certain players well, which is their favourite foot, if they like to cut in and turn, what their strengths and weaknesses are, but there have been a few slightly testy tackles too. ||"There have been a few more yellow cards this year and there's the odd confrontation, so there is some competition and a bit of needle, but there are no long-standing rivalries or punch-ups or anything like that - it's all pretty much forgiven by the time the final whistle goes."||To keep things fresh, no player has a pre-ordained team at the start of every season. Instead the two captains for that year pick new squads just as schoolchildren do on the playground, taking it in turns until there are no players left. The order of the selections are kept secret to avoid letting the last picks know when they were chosen - after all, with only 2,100 residents on the islands, the league can hardly risk putting any players' noses out of joint.||Changing the sides each year mean most players have no special affinity to one of the two teams, although Lethbridge says there are some "superstitious" stalwarts who claim to perform better for one rather than the other.||The selection process is also intended to keep sporting competition equal, although that doesn't always bear out across a whole season.||"Wanderers have tended to fair a little bit better, but that's ultimately down to who the captains pick," Lethbridge says. "This year, one of the first picks for the Gunners was expecting to be here all winter and then ended up getting a job in the Swiss Alps, so they lost their marquee signing so to speak.||"It can happen, people pick up injuries and have other commitments, but it tends to balance itself out - a team goes on a winning run of two or three games, then they lose two or three games because players are unavailable. This year, though, Wanderers had pretty much wrapped up the league four or five games before the end of the season."||The formalities were concluded with a 2-0 Wanderers victory in the 14th league meeting of the season on 5 March.||Being a small island community also means that some players are called away mid-game to deal with other issues, particularly policemen or firemen who are playing while on call. Sometimes, those impromptu absences can have a big bearing on the final outcome of a match.||"There's a guy called Dave Mumford - or Chuffer - who's a farmer and a few years ago his phone started going at half time and they said 'oi, your cows have escaped', so he had to run off to find them," explains Gibbons.||"We were 2-0 up at that point and had to go down to 10 men, so we ended up losing 3-2. In the end, it turned out they weren't even his cows."||Even with the league running on two teams, it's not unusual for player unavailability to mean one-game loans are made to even up the sides. In recent years, some games have had to be postponed because there weren't enough players.||Maintaining the necessary number of players has long been a concern for the Isles of Scilly Football League, with a lack of any further education options on the islands after the age of 16 meaning many young hopefuls move to Cornwall to continue their studies just as they're ready to play.||Some people, like Lethbridge, return to the islands when they get older and bolster the ranks, while anybody of playing age that moves to Scilly is soon approached about taking part.||It can make for a wide range of ages among the players, with a handful of over 50s playing until a few years ago and one former resident still making the occasional appearance into his 70s.||"There's always a danger [of the league running out of players]," says Gibbons. "As soon as people hit 16, they go to the mainland, so we lose about six of the kids each year, but we've been quite lucky that we've got five or six more in recent years, although the year might come when we have nobody. About five or six years ago, we were struggling because we didn't have the players and only had an eight-a-side team."||If that time does arrive, it won't be the end of football on the Isles of Scilly, though. A Boxing Day match between the veterans and an under-30s team is an annual tradition, while touring teams regularly visit to test themselves against the best players from the islets.||Each September, the Mal de Mer Sporting Club, which takes its name for the French for seasickness, cross over from the mainland to go up against the locals in a multi-sport competition, including darts, gig rowing, beach volleyball and, of course, football. ||There's also the Lyonesse Trophy, a semi-regular match against Penzance amateur side Dynamo Choughs to win what is dubbed as the world's smallest cup, measuring up at barely one centimetre tall. The novelty silverware grabbed the attention of Fifa, with the world governing body negotiating for the trophy to be displayed in its official museum in Zurich.||"We started playing Dynamo Choughs on our football tours in the early 2000s and one of their players is a metal worker, so he decided to make the smallest trophy he could," Gibbons explains.||"When Fifa came over and said it'd be great in their museum, he made a replica and they've got it at the moment. Even though it's only about one centimetre tall, people have still tried to put beer in there when they've won it, but it's not a big drink."||Gibbons and Secretary Matt Simons were treated to a VIP trip to Fifa's Zurich headquarters in February to see the cup displayed in all its glory and agree a deal to loan the Lyonesse Trophy to the museum for another five years.||Scilly's footballers are growing accustomed to the attention and regularly play host to journalists and TV crews from all over the world. ||The league also captures the imagination of some of the globe's biggest brands. Vodafone used the island as the base for a 2019 advertising campaign that featured Far (Fan Assistant Referee) - a crowd-sourced 5G video review system which allowed other Isles of Scilly residents to view and vote on controversial refereeing decisions remotely. ||But nothing has yet topped 2007 when sportswear manufacturer Adidas flew in a tranche of international stars as part of its Dream Big campaign.||Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Patrick Vieira, Anderson, Daniele de Rossi and Michael Ballack arrived on the islands to put young footballers through their paces, before relaxing on the beach and eating fish and chips.||Other, less welcome, visitors soon followed.||"A guy from St Martin's phoned the press to say Beckham was here, so a load of helicopters came over and he had to go, remembers Gibbons.  ||"They still needed one last shot over the bay so I filled in for Beckham."||"Someone did send a message to the production company to see if they wanted to do a revisit recently, but I don't think there's been a response," Lethbridge adds.||"We do get odd things come up and usually we'll find some time to do it because it's all good fun and it's good for Scilly because the islands rely on tourism and wanting people to come here and visit us, so any exposure helps with that."||It makes for a competition that's undeniably repetitive, but far from boring. || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/football/64987864

Walid Regragui: 'When will the first Arab or African coach get a job in the Premier League?'||Morocco head coach Walid Regragui has set his sights on becoming the first Arab Muslim manager in the Premier League.||Regragui was at the helm as the Atlas Lions made history last year by becoming the first African nation to reach a World Cup semi-final.||Despite losing to France, the 47-year-old has revealed his long-term personal ambitions include England's top flight.||"Of course, it's a goal I've had since the beginning of my career. I build it slowly," he told the BBC World Service, before asking, "When will the first Arab or African coach get a job in the Premier League?"||"We have people of colour but they are European. The World Cup showed we were capable but we're waiting for a club president, owner or chairman who has the courage to give us the chance."||Two managers born in Africa have lost their jobs in the top two divisions of English football this season.||Former France and Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira, who was born in Senegal, parted company with Crystal Palace in March, with the Eagles 12th in the Premier League at the time. Vieira had previously said he was "troubled" by the lack of black managers in both the men's and women's top flights in England.||Another ex Arsenal player, Ivory Coast's Kolo Toure, was sacked by Championship strugglers Wigan in January after only nine games in charge.||"We are starting to have black coaches in the Premier League and in France," Regragui continued. ||"Unfortunately, it's always complicated for African coaches in Europe. There is this lack of confidence, which can be legitimate even if I don't agree with it.||"I grew up in France, I played at the top level. I know I am capable of coaching at a very high level, which is in the Premier League, in France or in Spain. ||"The truth is that I am lucky to have made this World Cup. But which club owner, president or chairman will have the courage to come and bet on an African coach?||"I do think football is changing though."||For now, the immediate focus remains the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations, with Regragui previously stating Morocco cannot be "kings of the world before being kings of our continent".||The Atlas Lions were knocked out of the 2021 edition at the quarter-final stage by Egypt.||Regragui's predecessor, Vahid Halilhodzic, then parted ways with Morocco just three months before Qatar 2022 following a series of high-profile fall-outs, including with star player Hakim Ziyech.||Enter Regragui who had just led Wydad Casablanca to success in both the Moroccan domestic league and African Champions League.||"It was a surprise. Being manager of the national team was not an objective I had right away," Regragui revealed.||"It came quickly for me when I would have preferred to have experience in Europe first. ||"It's been an extraordinary year for me and my staff. We've worked hard to realise this dream and it's magnificent.||"We gave a lot of happiness to Moroccans, to the Africans and at this World Cup. We were a bit of a surprise team and people liked to see us giving our absolute maximum.||"We must be winners, we must have this state of mind. That's why I put pressure on myself to set an example. And that's why, famously here in Morocco, I have said that if we don't go to the semi-finals at the next Cup of Nations, I will resign. ||"In Morocco, we want to be a stronghold in Africa. And when we dominate our continent we can also dominate the world."||Should Regragui achieve his ambition of managing in the Premier League, he might have to learn how to be his own barista.||The former full-back, who began his career in the city of his birth with Racing Paris before joining Toulouse and won 45 caps for Morocco, is already having to adapt to the trappings of fame - as are his family. ||"It's difficult for me to have a coffee in Rabat," he admitted.||"My wife told me, 'Why did you take the team to the semi-finals of the World Cup? You brought yourself more problems!'||"That's how it is. The most important thing for me is to see happy people in my country still; two or three months after the World Cup they are still living this dream. ||"Sport has a value that is important, to give dreams to children and young people. ||"That is what we are trying to achieve at the moment with the national team. If it prevents me from drinking coffee, it's not a problem." ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/africa/65380257
London Marathon 2023: Kelvin Kiptum and Sifan Hassan win with superb runs||Kenya's Kelvin Kiptum smashed compatriot Eliud Kipchoge's course record to win the men's London Marathon in the second-fastest time ever.||The 23-year-old was just 16 seconds outside Kipchoge's world record, finishing in two hours one minute 25 seconds.||Sifan Hassan also produced a remarkable run to win the women's race.||The Dutch Olympic track champion, 30, suffered with a hip injury but battled to win on her debut at the distance.||Kiptum knocked one minute and 12 seconds off Kipchoge's previous course record to beat second-placed compatriot Geoffrey Kamworor by almost three minutes.||Britain's Mo Farah was ninth in his final London Marathon, with the 40-year-old four-time Olympic champion revealing after the race that he would finish his career at the Great North Run in September.||Hassan, who won the 5,000m and 10,000m at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, appeared out of the women's race after dropping back early on with a hip problem, but somehow fought back.||She then produced a sprint finish to win in two hours 18 minutes 33 seconds.||Switzerland's Marcel Hug knocked 50 seconds off his own course record to win a third consecutive London Marathon men's wheelchair race - and fifth in total.||Australia's Madison de Rozario held off Manuela Schar, of Switzerland, in a sprint finish to win the women's wheelchair event for a second time.||More than 48,000 runners are taking part in the marathon, raising millions of pounds for charity, with huge crowds lining the streets of London despite damp conditions.||The event has returned to its traditional date in the calendar, in April, for the first time since 2019 after being moved during the Covid-19 pandemic.||Hassan's rollercoaster of a race looked all but over after she fell off the leading group with just an hour gone.||"I had a problem with my hip, which made me stop. But it started to feel a little bit better," she told BBC Sport.||"And then I missed one of the drinks stations. I didn't practise that part of the race because I have been fasting [during Ramadan] and so that was quite difficult. But I needed it.||"At 20km I knew that I could kick on because I didn't feel that tired and I didn't care how I finished, I just wanted to get there."||After battling through the pain, Hassan's track speed proved telling down the Mall, as she beat Ethiopia's Alemu Megertu into second place, while Kenya's previously unbeaten Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir was third. ||"London has been my dream," added Hassan. "And now here I am, I was doubting that I could even finish. This is just amazing. I will never forget this in my whole life."||The women's field was billed as the greatest ever assembled, but Kenyan world record holder Brigid Kosgei dropped out after just three minutes, while Ethiopia's defending champion Yalemzerf Yehualaw was fifth. ||Sam Harrison, 27, was the first British woman home, clocking a new personal best of 2:25:59 as she finished 11th. ||It was the fifth-fastest time by a British woman in the event. ||It was perhaps made more poignant that Farah should reveal a date for the end of his career on a day when Kiptum announced his arrival as marathon's newest world star.||Farah had already made clear that this would be his last time running the London race and he said he was close to tears on his way round.||"London has been so great to me over the years and I wanted to be here to say thank you to the crowd and the support that was just amazing," he said.||"Part of me was wanting to cry. The people were amazing, even in the rain to line the streets and that's what this is all about. It's what has kept me going for so long throughout my career."||Kiptum produced the fastest marathon debut in Valencia in December, where he finished in 2:01:53 - the third-fastest time in history.||He went faster still on the streets of London, leaving a high-class field in his wake, with Ethiopia's reigning world champion Tamirat Tola in third, three minutes and 34 seconds behind.||Emile Cairess, 25, produced a superb run to finish as the first British man home, taking sixth in 2:08:07 on his marathon debut. ||It was the third-fastest marathon time by a British man - behind Farah and Steve Jones - and the second fastest by a Briton in the London race. ||Four British runners finished in the top 10, with Phil Sesemann eighth and Chris Thompson 10th.||Switzerland's Hug, 37, dominated the men's wheelchair race to finish in one hour 23 minutes 48 seconds, well ahead of the Netherlands' Jetze Plat in second, with Japan's Tomoki Suzuki third.||Britain's David Weir, 43, finished his 24th London Marathon in fifth place.||The women's race was much closer, with the four favourites making it on the Mall together before De Rozario and Schar pulled away.||De Rozario won in one hour 38 minutes 52 seconds, with defending champion Catherine Debrunner, of Switzerland, in third and the United States' Susannah Scaroni fourth.||Eden Rainbow-Cooper, 21, who was third in 2022, was the first Briton home in seventh.||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||https://www.bbc.com//sport/athletics/65364808
County Championship: Middlesex chase 249 for thrilling win over Nottinghamshire||Half-centuries from Pieter Malan and Max Holden propelled Middlesex to an unlikely first win of the season as they chased down 249 to overcome Nottinghamshire by four wickets in a gripping finish at Lord's.||The pair both passed 50 for the first time this season, with Malan hitting 61 and Holden 53 to secure a result that had looked highly improbable after wet weather wiped out most of the first two sessions.||But Nottinghamshire opted to force the pace, declaring on their overnight total of 158-6 and setting up a 40-over pursuit more reminiscent of the Sunday League that ran in that format until 1992.||Although Stuart Broad took three wickets, Middlesex held their nerve to scramble home with six balls to spare and register their first success since returning to the top flight of the County Championship.||Despite an initial rain delay in the morning, the players began warming up on the outfield in preparation for a 12:30 BST start, but the covers were soon back on as the drizzle developed into a heavier downpour.||Umpires Alex Wharf and Martin Saggers eventually sanctioned a resumption at 15:30, with Nottinghamshire declaring immediately and giving the hosts 40 overs to chase the target.||Middlesex promoted Stephen Eskinazi to opener - a role he has filled with great success in white-ball cricket - and his drive to the cover boundary off Broad's second ball served as an indication of their intent.||Broad made the breakthrough by trapping Eskinazi in front for 11 but Mark Stoneman gave Brett Hutton the charge, lifting him over the top for four as well as benefitting from the odd edge through the slip area.||Stoneman flicked Broad into the grandstand for six as he advanced to 43 from 32 deliveries, eventually departing leg before to Dane Paterson and handing the baton over to Holden, who promptly pierced the field for successive boundaries.||With Nottinghamshire deploying five or six men in the deep at times, the left-hander continued to pick out the gaps as he and Malan kept pace with the required rate of just under a run a ball.||Their partnership realised 94 from 77 deliveries, with skipper Steven Mullaney eventually finding a way to break it as he tempted Malan to hole out to deep square leg with 73 still needed.||Broad returned for his second spell, switching to the Nursery End and he soon claimed the wicket of Holden, caught swishing down the leg side before the England seamer persuaded Luke Hollman to chip to mid-on.||Middlesex lost John Simpson in the same manner and, with overhead conditions dimming as they inched towards the target, Paterson sent down two tight overs to turn up the pressure on the batting side.||But Ryan Higgins, with an unbeaten 22 from as many deliveries, steered Middlesex home - although the tension showed as Nottinghamshire missed the chance to run out Sam Robson when he belatedly scampered through for the winning single off Broad.||Report supplied by ECB Reporters' Network||Three single Kiwi women are in search of the man of their dreams in FBoy Island NZ||A footballing whirlwind in the eye of a tabloid storm...||Look at the actions taken as the Third Reich faces collapse in the final weeks of World War II||Detain or release: a raw documentary takes you inside the high stakes world of parole hearings|| || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || ||Want to get into cricket?
