Liverpool only have nine games left.||Because of that, some are suggesting the Reds could benefit from a feeling of "nothing to lose", and that the pressure may now be off. So can they now build on that second half performance against the Gunners, and take it to Leeds on Monday?||Remember that Liverpool put seven past Manchester United not that long ago, but then went to Bournemouth and lost.

Read Thursday's full gossip column||We asked you for your views on Liverpool not pursuing Jude Bellingham this summer - here are some more comments:||Mike: If this news is right, which I am hoping is wrong, this is a huge disaster. We need quality players to build around, not some substandard players who do nothing for gaining on the top three teams.||Paul: Missing out on a world class player is forgivable. What is unforgivable is to not sign anyone for multiple windows in order to get said player, then back out because of money despite the price being known for years. It's not like Dortmund suddenly asked for 100m more than expected.||Steve: Under FSG Liverpool will never be able to compete with the wealthier teams and this is compounded by the failure to qualify for the Champions League. Recent success was built on the Coutinho sale. Bellingham was never going to happen. Neves, Mac Allister and Mount are more realistic targets unless we get new wealthier owners.||Ben: What were the realistic chances of signing Bellingham anyway? Even if we did sign him, the midfield problem still wouldn't be solved. Both Ox and Keita are leaving, leaving behind a very weak midfield that a single signing won't fix.||Gareth: Possibly for the best not signing Jude, could have been a similar scenario to Pogba when he returned to Manchester United with a price tag mindset. Moving for realistic targets makes sense; Tielemans, Mount, Ward-Prowse etc. Rebuild needs to return the midfield to basics and strengthen the spine of the squad. Then the rest of the team can shine again.||Giulia Bould, BBC Radio Merseyside||Despite being linked with a move for Jude Bellingham seemingly since the young midfielder could crawl, Liverpool have now decided to cool their interest with the fingers of blame pointing firmly at the clubs owners.||It is thought the Borussia Dortmund players star has risen so high that the price tag of 100m plus is just too much for Fenway Sports Group to cough up this summer.||After taking a quadruple fight right to the bitter end last season, the lacklustre campaign for Jurgen Klopps side this time has highlighted the frailty of an aging squad and a failure to recruit properly.||Fans were already frustrated at their midfield woes but the Bellingham news is shifting the focus onto how their club is being run.||Many have asked why FSG held out believing they would snap up the 19 year-old in the coming transfer window only to back out now. It had been indicated that the Reds hadn't splashed as much cash as was needed because they were sure they'd land the England favourite.||Supporters were already growing tired of the unambitious transfer policy and now they have big questions about the strategy going forward if they're ever to rival the likes of Manchester City again when it comes to winning a 20th league title.||We asked for your views after Liverpool announced they would not pursue a move for Jude Bellingham this summer.||Here are some of your comments:||Stephen: It says everything about the state of the club when we can not compete with top clubs for top players. We are now an average Premier League club, being throttled by a company that clearly isn't interested in Liverpool FC as a football club.||Aarif: So, Liverpool supposedly bid for Tchouameni last summer and opted to then put that money towards Bellingham next summer. Where's that money gone?! Bellingham was always going to be expensive. We are in this position because of FSG's model, which is no longer fit for purpose. It's time they sold it to a group who can compete with our rivals. Fed up!||David: Liverpool were never likely to get Jude Bellingham with the likes of Man City and Real Madrid obviously interested. Mason Mount would be an ideal fit for a midfield short on energy.||William: I'm not surprised that Liverpool are not going to try and sign Bellingham. It's a lot of money for one player when we need a number of players in the summer to freshen and improve the squad for next season.||Jamie: Not going after Bellingham is definitely the wrong move, the price tag is completely justified! He is a player that could be the heart and soul of a Liverpool team for 10+ years. How you could say he isnt worth it is baffling.||Jordan Chamberlain, Empire of the Kop, external||The nail in the coffin of an incredibly poor Liverpool season.||Jude Bellingham will not be signed, because the club realise they need to spend the required funds on a major rebuild instead. The problem is, part of the reason Liverpool need a rebuild is because they have stagnated in the transfer market for years in the expectation of an eventual move for the Borussia Dortmund superstar.||But, by not improving an ageing, injured midfield - for which only Thiago has been signed permanently in five years - the Reds have dropped the baton.||An entirely new midfield is needed given the performances of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho this term. Bellingham was supposed to be the last piece, but the Reds need an entirely new jigsaw.||At least there is recognition of the scale of improvements required. Declan Rice would be a great start. He would be a fantastic long-term replacement for Henderson, while either of the Brighton duo Moises Caicedo or Alexis Mac Allister would strengthen us.||Liverpool need battlers, though. Energetic fighters who can track runners and provide a platform from which the attack can run riot and the full-backs can get forward. Manuel Ugarte from Sporting Lisbon and Manu Kone from Borussia Monchengladbach are interesting options.||The reality is, we need at least three to soothe the disappointment of Bellingham's departure.||Now all the Reds can hope for is that he does not join Manchester United or Manchester City.||Dom from The Road End Podcast believes if Liverpool are going to do a rebuild, he does not see where Curtis Jones fits in.||The 22-year-old has scored three goals in 54 Premier League games.||Speaking on BBC Radio Merseyside's The Red Kop podcast, he said: "I have watched Curtis Jones since his youth days as I live right next to the academy.||"He has always been a confident lad and always looked like he could pull something out of the bag. He gets a lot of unwarranted criticism in the Liverpool first team, for me that is partly down to the run of games that he gets.||"Dont get me wrong, he hasn't pulled up any trees when he has played on many occasions - although it must be difficult when you are in one week and out the next six. So I always have sympathy for players in that situation, but his ability has always been there and you can clearly see that from what he did for the goal [against Arsenal], with that backheel.||"He has got it in him, we just dont see it enough. He has had injuries and things going on so it was nice to see him back in there. I just dont personally see, if we are going to rebuild, how he is going to fit in.||"But that is up to him to answer that question."||Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds||"I told Bill Shankly I needed to think about moving to Liverpool. That was a lie - I knew I was going to Manchester United."||In 1973, Lou Macari was leaving Celtic and sent to England without knowing which club was signing him.||On the latest episode of BBC Scotland's Sacked In The Morning podcast, Macari reveals how he turned down Anfield for Old Trafford - and his reasons why.||"I was looking at their team and they had Kevin Keegan, John Toshack, Emlyn Hughes... household names and I thought where can I get in?" said Macari. ||"Then Shankly was ferocious. I was shaking when I met him, and shaking when I shook his hand!||"He told me to watch a game (an FA Cup replay against Burnley) from the directors' box and then he would see me after.||"There was only one empty seat in the box and that was next to me - Paddy Crerand, who was assistant manager at Manchester United, came and sat in it.||"He told me not to sign but to come with him so I spent the most uncomfortable 90 minutes of my life thinking what I was going to say to Shankly!"||What was it about United that persuaded Macari to turn Liverpool down?||And which clubs was he frightened about joining as his taxi drove down the M6?||Listen to the full story from 29'00 on BBC Sounds||What do you make of the news that Liverpool will not make a move for Jude Bellingham this summer because of the money involved?||The 19-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Anfield in recent years but any move for the England international could cost in excess of 100m at least.||How big a blow is this?

I am starting to really fear for them.||I keep on saying it but Forest's terrible away form means they rely so heavily on picking up points at the City Ground and they are under pressure to keep doing that, whoever they face there.||That makes this game a really interesting one, because Manchester United also need to win it and their away form is not exactly convincing either.||The return of Casemiro from suspension is a big boost for Erik ten Hag's side but they are going to miss Marcus Rashford while he is out injured and being in the Europa League has left their squad at full stretch. Because of that, I'm going for a draw.||Jack's prediction: I think Brennan Johnson is brilliant for Forest but people are comparing him to Gareth Bale for Wales and he's nowhere near that level yet. Johnson is fast and skilful but he hasn't got Bale's finesse - very few players have. Let's go for him to make the difference for Forest here though! 2-1.||Find out what Chris and Jack predicted for the rest of the weekend's games and cast your vote||Mark: Erik ten Hag has done a good job with what he has to work with but the truth is too many players are not good enough. With our injury list and nine games in April, we need to make sure we get into the top four as anything else is a bonus. Ten Hag needs a big clear out in the close season but is hamstrung by the United sale.||Jonathan: Serious lack in depth. Beyond the starting XI, only maybe two or three players are good enough. The back line is also not comfortable playing the ball from the back. It is amazing to even see the results that have been got from this team to date. With proper investment, we can see something special from United.||James: Any squad will get injuries - it's just we are getting some potentially key injuries clustered together at the same time, which is unfortunate. Expectations need to be kept in check, as I think we have done very well this season overall. The end of the season is only going to help highlight our capabilities and fragilities for our next season.||Ioannis: Still a work in progress. United need at least four top-quality players who at the same time should be real leaders that can motivate and organise.||Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag says he will have to "use the squad" during a potentially hectic end to the season, as he deals with further injury absences.||Ten Hag did not provide any further updates on the injuries sustained by centre-backs Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane against Sevilla on Thursday.||Still in the Europa League and FA Cup, United could potentially have another 15 matches to play this season.||"We have depth in the squad and we have to use the squad," said Ten Hag before Sunday's Premier League game at Nottingham Forest. "It's what we did yesterday [against Sevilla]. In the meantime you have to win games, so also you need the tactical approach to win the games.||"We have good players and when we have problems with injuries and suspensions, we have depth in the squad."||United next face a Forest side that slipped into the relegation zone last weekend.||"We know what we can expect on Sunday, they are in survival mode and they will run for their lives, so we have to be ready for that game," added Ten Hag.||Simon Stone, BBC Sport||Erik ten Hag has espoken to the media before Manchester United's Premier League game at Nottingham Forest.||Here are the main lines from his news conference:||Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay could return after missing last night's Europa League draw with Sevilla, with Ten Hag stating: "We have two sessions to go. It can be that Scott and Luke will return to the squad."||Ten Hag had no update on Lisandro Martinez and was asked about reports in Argentina that the defender had broken his foot, adding: "I have an idea (of the injury) but lets wait. When we have news we will give it but lets let the medical people do their assessment and give a complete diagnosis."||He was also not prepared to offer an update on Raphael Varane, who left the field at half-time.||In referencing defensive cover, Ten Hag added: "We have a lot of decent centre-halves. We have proved in the past and in this season that we have four or five very good centre-halves who can do the job."||Asked if players brought into the squad could be judged to not be up to pace, Ten Hag said: "When you find excuses, you have to look for another club. You wait for your moment and when it is there, you have to contribute."||Ten Hag took Bruno Fernandes and Antony off last night when it was 2-0 because he feared both players were in danger of getting sent off.||Given United gave away a two-goal lead, Ten Hag pointed to a view he had made a mistake, stating: "It's easy afterwards. If he had got sent off then you tell me, 'why don't you get him off? Why did you go for the risk?'"||On using Anthony Martial for 90 minutes as he continues his comeback from injury, Ten Hag said: "It is a risk to play him for 90 minutes. We cant take it at the moment as we dont have so many options in the forwards. We have to be careful. We know when he gets a lot of load, he gets injured. We have to manage that."||Get Man Utd notifications||This is Nottingham Forests first home league game against Manchester United since February 1999, when they lost 8-1 under Ron Atkinson with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scoring four times as a substitute.||Nottingham Forest are winless (D3 L6) and without a clean sheet in their past nine Premier League games. In fact, Forest are winless in all 23 league games in which they have conceded this season (D8 L15), with all six of their victories being to nil.||Jesse Lingard has yet to score for Nottingham Forest in the Premier League this season. He could become the third former Manchester United player to score his first Premier League goal for a side against the Red Devils, after Keith Gillespie at Sheffield United in 2006-07, and Dan James for Fulham this season.||Should Manchester United be looking to sign Marcel Sabitzer permanently?||The Austria international made it three goals in the past five games with a quickfire double against Sevilla in the Europa League and, says BBC Sport's football reporter Simon Stone, he could offer a cheap option in the summer.||"Sabitzer has been superb," Stone told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. "There is a lot of debate around whether they should be trying to keep him.||"Bizarrely he has scored more in five games for United than he did in 18 months for Bayern where he only got two. ||"I would not imagine they would be too bothered about letting him go and United might profit from signing someone low key like that."||The 29-year-old was signed in January after the injury to Christian Eriksen and may find game time more limited after the Denmark midfielder's return to fitness.||Yet if he continues to be influential in front of goal, he could prove very handy to support United's fight on three fronts, and beyond into next season.||Following Manchester United's disappointing 2-2 draw with Sevilla, we asked you for your thoughts on the game and the injury blow to Lisandro Martinez.||Here are a selection of your comments:||Mark: It's the first time I can lay the blame firmly at the feet of Ten Hag last night. Unbelievable substitutions and at the wrong times! That said, it always leads back to the lack of real investment by the Glazer. Our squad depth beyond the first say 14-15 players is shockingly poor, dare I say Championship level at best.||Catherine: The first goal, Martinez injury... My thoughts were "our season is over". It all seemed to cave in within five minutes. Yet again United proved they've not got that killer instinct needed to perform at the top. Same story of we should've killed the game in the first half. Harsh reality is we're still nowhere near top teams in Europe.||Chloe: Very unlucky to draw - two crazy own goals and injuries to two important players - but still confident we're the better team and will win in Spain.||Chris: As soon as Ten Hag rests his starting XI or one of them is suspended or injured, United play terribly and are rudderless, especially when Maguire plays! ETH has done an amazing job so far, but the squad is nowhere near good enough. Strength in depth is poor.||Ricky: United started like a house on fire but the tempo dropped alarmingly once the second goal went in. I fully expected Ten Hag to put things right at half time but they came out just as lethargic. Yes, they didn't get the rub of the green but some of Ten Hag's substitutions and comments about being unlucky with the goals is a worry.||Stephen: Man Utd have made huge progress this season, but due to the owners still making life difficult we are still short of players who can play and make a difference. Once we get injuries like we are at present the players coming on are not good enough. We are playing the same players every game and injuries will always happen.||Get Man Utd notifications||Napoli hotshot Victor Osimhen's "dream" is to play in the Premier League.||He idolises Didier Drogba. ||There's a side in west London in dire need of a goalscorer.||However, argues Italian football expert Mina Rzouki, an Osimhen move to Chelsea in the summer is unlikely.||"He is a player who can play in any squad in the world," Rzouki told BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast.||"He would be a blessing for any team but he does need to be alongside players who are good on the play and play perfect passes.||"Somehow, I don't feel like it's Chelsea - in fact I think he would like to end up somewhere more like Manchester United."||Osimhen has 25 goals in 29 appearances for the Serie A leaders this season but could stay in Italy if a deal is not acceptable.||"They don't have to sell him," continued Rzouki. "They are a very well run club, in profit, and do not need to lose a player. ||"They have said though if a ridiculous offer is being made, it would be vary hard for them to say no."||More on Osimhen from 9'40 on BBC Sounds||Jadon Sancho has an opportunity to step up in the absence of Manchester United top-scorer Marcus Rashford but, says Peter Schmeichel, the England forward was invisible against Sevilla in the Europa League.||The 23-year-old has five goals in 29 appearances this season but missed a swathe of the campaign and has consistently struggled to replicate the form he showed for Borussia Dortmund at Old Trafford.||Schmeichel admits he saw nothing on Thursday night to suggest Sancho is any closer.||"I fail to remember anything he did well and that's the sad truth," Schmeichel told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ||"There is nothing on his shoulders - no-one is expecting miracles. He's one part of a team that is supposed to be able to attack from either side, to mix it up and offer variety in their play.||"He has a great opportunity at Old Trafford with a manager who believes in him and wants to help him. ||"Now he needs to go on the pitch and show that."||Further analysis available on BBC Sounds||Manchester United let a lead slip but still hold major hope of European progress.||Their 2-2 draw with Sevilla also featured a worrying injury to Lisandro Martinez though.||So what are your thoughts on the prospect of him missing games? And what did you think of the draw?||Tell us here||The bidding process to own Manchester United going to a third round is down to one of two possible reasons, says BBC Sport reporter Simon Stone.||"In simple terms, it shows that nobody has bid the money that the Glazers want in order to sell the club," Stone told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ||"Or, it shows they cannot get the Elliot Investment Group to give them a massive loan on the type of interest rate they want.||"Indeed, it's not entirely clear that the Glazers are even willing to sell - and if this process moves on much longer without resolution that will affect the money they have in the market at the start of the transfer window."||Ex-United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel criticised how "confusing" it has been for supporters.||"You hear all kinds of different scenarios and it is confusing for fans," he said. "The fans want the Glazers out so if they are going to sell, then let the process run its course, even if it takes two years.||"If they are not going to sell, then let them get on with it. ||"And then, there is the fact the stadium needs a lot of renovation. You cannot hide away from that and it cannot happen until the sale or not sale has happened.||"That's urgent."||Listen to more discussion on the race to own United from 20'45 on BBC Sounds||Get the latest episode of the How to Buy a Football Club podcast||Manchester United's late capitulation to Sevilla in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final proved they "are not a top European team yet", according to their former goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.||Erik ten Hag's side raced into a two-goal lead and were cruising against the Spanish strugglers only to wilt in the face of late pressure and end up drawing.||"When they were two goals up, they needed to up the tempo and go for the third goal," Schmeichel told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. "That's an ability Ten Hag needs to add.||"It was a little bit too casual from certain players and that is my worry. We have seen their lack of ability to manage a game and couple of times this season."||Schmeichel also pointed out a lack of on-field leadership at Old Trafford, most notably when a stricken Lisandro Martinez was carried from the field by two Sevilla players.||"The club captain was on the pitch and should have managed that situation," he said. "Sevilla had momentum and they carried him off because they wanted to keep going. ||"United were under pressure so they needed to play the professional game. Instead, it meant United did not have time to regroup, have a conversation with each other and calm it down."||Spanish football expert Guillem Balague agreed with Schmeichel, saying: "Manchester United should have managed the game better.||"That's the difference between a good team that can be brilliant and a very, very good side that United are not yet."||Key stats||Man Utd failed to win a match in major European competition in which they had a two-goal lead for the first time since a 3-3 draw with Basel in September 2011.||They remain unbeaten in their last 25 home games in all competitions, winning 21 and drawing four.||More analysis of a dramatic night available on BBC Sounds||Bayern Munich are interested in signing England striker Harry Kane, 29, from Tottenham this summer, however Manchester United are favourites because the player wants to stay in the Premier League.

Arsenal||Follow  Arsenal||Mikel Arteta and David Moyes have traded compliments before their reunion in the dugouts at London Stadium on Sunday.||Arteta played under Moyes at Everton for seven years and could not hide his "admiration" for his old boss.||"I would go through a brick wall for him when he was my manager," said Arteta. "He's a very special human being and a man who honours his word.||"He got the best out of me because he's a really good coach, exceptional at managing a group and dealing with individuals. He's someone I learned a lot from."||While not as emotive, Moyes praised Arteta for the turnaround he has accomplished at Arsenal, with the Gunners flying high at the top of the table.||"I'm very impressed," he said. "Surprised? Not really. Mikel has built a really good side.||"He was getting a lot of criticism at one point but he always felt he had a good team and they would come out of that period, and they have done.||"Great credit to Mikel and his team - they've done a good job."||For this weekend's Premier League fixtures, Chris Sutton is up against Jack Jones, frontman with Welsh indie band Trampolene.||Sutton's prediction: 0-2||Arsenal need to bounce back here after what happened to them at Anfield.||I can see why their draw against Liverpool is viewed by some as being a good point gained, especially because of Aaron's Ramsdale brilliant save to deny the Reds at the end - it could have been worse for Mikel Arteta's side.||But I know how I felt as a player when we led 2-0 in games and let it slip, and it will have felt like a defeat for the Gunners.||That Granit Xhaka moment, where he clashed with Trent Alexander-Arnold at the end of the first half and got the Anfield crowd going, turned out to be costly. I do feel for Xhaka a bit but, at the end of the season, when people look back at the pivotal moments in the title race, that could well be one of them.||So, the way the leaders react is going to be fascinating. The wheels could have come off when they lost to Manchester City in February but they responded with seven successive wins.||Nothing less than a win will do for them here either, and I think they will get it.||West Ham got a really vital victory over Fulham last week and they are still desperate for points so they will give everything here - but Arsenal should be too good for them.||Jack's prediction: I am going for a bit of a shock here. I don't think Arsenal are going to fall apart or anything that dramatic, but this is a London derby and it is going to be hard for them even though the Hammers are down at the bottom of the table. I would love Arsenal to put up a fight and take the title race to the last game, but that's a big ask - City just look in ridiculous form at the moment, and they have a really good chance of winning the treble. 1-0||Find out what Chris and Jack predicted for the rest of the weekend's games and cast your vote||Mikel Arteta says he has not been surprised by the starring role Gabriel Martinelli has played in Arsenal's title push this season.||The Brazil forward has scored 14 Premier League goals in 30 appearances this season after managing just six during the entire 2021-22 campaign.||Asked why he has been so effective, Arteta was typically understated.||"He's playing more games that's for sure," he said. "He's got another year of experience and a huge understanding with his team-mates.||"And, it's the way he approaches every single session, his training, his life  - it is to be the best. ||"When that happens, only good outcomes will be in front of him and I am not surprised about that."||Only four players (Erling Haaland, Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Ivan Toney) have more league goals than Martinelli this season, and Arteta warned there was more to come. ||"The good thing is there is still a lot to improve," said the Arsenal boss.||Mikel Arteta has been speaking to the media before Arsenals game at West Ham on Sunday.||Here are the key lines from his news conference:||Arteta confirmed William Saliba would be absent but is "progressing well". There was better news on Eddie Nketiah who is fit to return.||He appreciates Aaron Ramsdales displays this season: "You need individuals to perform at the highest level. Certainly, you need your keeper to be very present. Every team that has won titles, their goalkeeper is a big contribution."||On small details: "You need luck in the title race. Sometimes its about inches and they have to go your way."||He pays little attention to percentage stats suggesting Manchester City will win the Premier League: "When you asked them at the start of the season it was like this. So nothing has changed."||On David Moyes, who was Artetas boss at Everton: "More than respect, its admiration. I would go through a brick wall for him when he was my manager.

Strong, fast, aggressive and just a nightmare for defenders. ||Taran, Birmingham: It is difficult to compare across eras, but Thierry Henry, for me, remains the greatest. On one hand he was graceful and elegant in his style of play, but when he decided to flick the switch, the opposition was done for. I didn't see this match in person, but his performance in 2003 for Arsenal in their 5-1 win in the San Siro against Inter Milan epitomises that.||Robbie Perkins, Tranmere: Robin van Persie.

So the spark is the challenge that gets the crowd going but the goal makes a totally different team talk at half time and it changes the perspective of the Liverpool dressing room. ||"When teams like Liverpool get going at home, and there's a handful of sides like it in the Premier League, you can't stop it. It doesn't matter if you're Arsenal, you can't stop it. There's an energy, there's a lift amongst the 11 players, it changes. If you look at the statistics at the end of the game it's very much a point gained."||The point takes Mikel Arteta's men six clear at the top of the Premier League, but the title is now also in Manchester City's hands as they have played a match fewer and host the Gunners at the Etihad on 26 April.||"When the narrative after the game is two points dropped I think that they're looking for 'you're bottling it' and they haven't bottled it," said Brown.||"This is Liverpool at home, they're having a bad season but they're like a cornered tiger. They can come out and strike any time and when they get on top of you they're still going to be a very, very good side. So, I think it's very much a point gained. If anything I'd say they've done well to hang on in the end."||Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds||We asked for your views on Sunday's Premier League game between Liverpool and Arsenal.||Here are some of your comments:||Liverpool fans||Jay: Poor first 40 minutes but after Salahs goal it was mostly Liverpool and we should of won. Massive summer rebuild and if players wont come because of no Champions League we dont want them.||James: The first half was very much the usual this season. Sloppy mistakes and losing possession. A shame to have conceded those two goals so easily considering how well we played after pulling one back. We looked like the Liverpool from previous years. However it was frustrating to miss so many good chances. If only we could play like that away!||Tracy: The spark and fight is back at Liverpool! Exciting game, good to get our mojo back on track.||Andy: I dont understand why we have to wait for a tussle between Alexander-Arnold and Xhaka to give Liverpool some energy. We stood off Arsenal in the first half. Very poor.||Arsenal fans||Tanay: That match felt like a loss. The football was scintillating, end-to-end, but it was a reminder of Saliba's importance to the team.||Felix: Dominated Liverpool in the first 30 minutes but then lost our composure. Maybe a bit better defensive security would have prevented an equaliser. But well come back stronger as always.||Keith: This is a massive point in the title race. Although Arsenal were hanging on at the end, to come to Anfield, wherever they are in the league, and compete in the way they did shows how good a chance they have of lifting the trophy at the end of the season.||Dylan: I'll take the draw, honestly we were lucky to even get that. It was a crucial game in the title race and we have more important matches coming up like City, Chelsea and Newcastle. I still believe we can win this, as long as we get a point against City and don't drop too many more.|| 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

They have got a bit about them too - Philip Billing is having an outstanding season in midfield, and has scored some big goals.||I really don't know what to make of Tottenham, though. I thought they would lose to Brighton last week, and they really should have lost - but they got away with it in a big way.||My gut is telling me that Bournemouth are capable of getting something here, but then Spurs do have Harry Kane and they are still in the hunt for a Champions League place too.

To give him training and the right timing to play. To not take risks," Tottenham's acting head coach said ahead of Bournemouth's visit this weekend.||"He's not the only one who wants to be on the pitch every time. Every player wants to be on the pitch.||"Sometimes they hide their condition to try to play, to have one possibility to score, to do something good.||"But now when you live experience like Richarlison this season, maybe they can grow in their mindset. I hope that Richy understands that we are taking care of him."||At their respective news conferences on Friday, Tottenham interim boss Cristian Stellini and Brighton manager Roberto de Zerbi were asked to reflect on  touchline confrontations between Spurs and Brighton staff during their fractious meeting last weekend.||Stellini and De Zerbi were shown red cards at the time and both clubs have since been charged by the Football Association.||Stellini said he had not spoken to De Zerbi this week and added: "What we created in that moment was not a good impression for anyone, so maybe for the atmosphere we created, the decision [to charge both clubs] is good. We have to be better. Personally I'm happy we showed we are a team, we are linked, we are close and we defend ourselves and our club."||As for De Zerbi, he had "no regrets" about his conduct.||He said: "I didn't say bad words and I respect always. You have your style of life, I have my style and when I have something to say I am used to speaking in a direct way. For sure I can improve in a lot of things and in a lot of parts of my work but I can't and I don't want to lose my DNA - my DNA is passion. I'm not better than the other coaches, I am a normal coach and the best part of myself is the passion, to transfer my passion."||Tottenham interim manager Cristian Stellini has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League match against Bournemouth.||Here are the main lines from his news conference:||Richarlison is back in the squad for Saturday's game but other injured players, such as Ben Davies and Emerson Royal, are not yet ready to return.||On Richarlison he added: "We have to take care with him to give him training and the right time to play. Don't take risks."||On the confrontations that led to Stellini and Brighton manager Roberto de Zerbi being sent from the touchline last weekend, Stellini said: "What we created in that moment was not a good impression."||Asked if he has spoken to De Zerbi, he added: "No. These type of things stay on the pitch, you forget this type of situation immediately after the game. Theres nothing to say."||Stellini added that what occurred, and the aftermath of it, showed "we are a team, we are linked and we are close."||He said the final eight league games are "eight finals" as Tottenham look to secure Champions League football again next season.||Sign up for Tottenham notifications||Bayern Munich are interested in signing England striker Harry Kane, 29, from Tottenham this summer, however Manchester United are favourites because the player wants to stay in the Premier League.

Far too many great goals for Tottenham to single one out. His partnership with Alan Gilzean was a delight. Still in the record books, which is remarkable given the pitches he played on and the tackles he suffered. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min are very good, but Greaves and Gilzean would surpass them in today's conditions.||Bill Watt, West Yorkshire: Harry Kane, the only opposition striker I have ever seen clapped off [when substituted] by me and my fellow Huddersfield fans, at our ground during our brief visit to the Premier League. I was terrified every time the ball went near him.||Martin Baldwin, Brighton: Jermain Defoe - scored the most Premier League goals as a substitute. So tenacious and dogged, right from his emergence at West Ham and through to his Tottenham and Portsmouth days. Always looked like he would score and seemed to love being on the pitch.

This eventually led to the equaliser, and had it not been for VAR decisions, could have been more.||Weve been on the receiving end of dubious VAR decisions, so Im not complaining about some fortune in our favour.

Im not saying we have to press high up the field the whole time, but at least get closer to the opposition when theyre in our half.||I was somewhat hopeful, that after both managers got sent off and with Mason in charge, wed see some positive changes.

Brighton were by far the better team. We are where we are in the table only because Chelsea and Liverpool are having poor seasons. The thing I love about teams like Brighton, is that they play to their players strengths. Why can't we do the same? We have great players playing a system they're not comfortable with.||Simon: Brighton, a real team with a clear vision and pattern of play, Spurs a team with some great individual players. On this occasion the better team lost. Spurs used to be a team with a clear vision and pattern of play. We now need a manager who can deliver that again.||Mick: Its simple to see Spurs will not make the top four this season. Now is time to bring in a new manager and give him the rest of the season to get to know the players hes got, who he wants to keep, who wont fit in and who he needs to bring in. Then have the pre-season to put it together.||James: We didn't deserve to win but we did and that's all that matters now. The defence has been and continues to be shocking and should have cost us again and whilst we continue to use the same poor tactics at the back I struggle to see how we can get any points from Manchester United, Newcastle and Liverpool. The season can't end soon enough. ||Brighton fans||Baltos: Seagulls robbed yet again by poor refereeing. VAR errors and bad referees have cost six or seven points to date, crucial for European qualification.||Hal: If points were given for PGMOL apologies then wed be top of the league! We were absolutely robbed, not by a disjointed Spurs, but by the match officials. Shocking! If we miss out on Europe by three or four points, it will be wholly down to them. Incompetence of the highest order!||Gez: When you're beaten by a better team you accept it and move on. But every Brighton fan is finding this is so hard to take right now because so many incorrect decisions went against us.||Andrew: As some may have stated or inferred here, the impassioned response from many Brighton fans, irrespective of accusation of bias, is that this was more than just a game of football. For the Albion, so much rests on European football. More than just the joy of something never previously achieved but the greatest chance of manager and player retention.||With Arsenal's dramatic draw, an inspired win for Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace and three fortuitous points for Spurs, there was plenty for The Far Post podcast's team to discuss after the weekend.||Add to that West Ham keeping David Moyes in his job for another week, Fulham looking like they're heading to the beach already, Chelsea's continuing chaos and Thomas Frank's potential suitors, and there's no shortage of talking points in this episode.||The full episode of BBC Radio London's The Far Post podcast is available to listen to now on BBC Sounds||Still yet to catch up on all the action from Saturday's Premier League fixtures?||Watch Match of the Day on BBC iPlayer now||And, if you missed Sunday's Match of the Day 2, you can find it here.||Tottenham have registered an interest in signing Morocco winger Hakim Ziyech, 30, from Chelsea this summer.

I want to build and create a strong way, we have to be very consistent and progressively improve."||On the impact of Ashley Young for the team, he said: "I am happy with him, he uses his experience to help the team and I appreciate this a lot."||The Aston Villa women's team take on Chelsea in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and Emery feels everything is "positive within the Aston Villa family" right now, adding: "We have to be proud of them."||Sign up for Aston Villa notifications here||Richard Sutherland, The Villa Park podcast, external||Now known as the loveable host of Homes Under the Hammer, once upon a time Dion Dublin was a central defender's worst nightmare and one of Aston Villa's toughest players.||Always sticking his head in where it hurts, two major moments gained Dublin legendary status amongst Villa supporters.||During a Premier League game against Sheffield Wednesday in December 1999 the striker sustained a potentially life threatening broken neck, career ending for most mere mortals.

Good news, then, to find that Villas recent results have been exactly that: 19 points from their last seven games continuing the surge that saw them break out of the orbit of the relegation battle, and then keep going.||By all accounts, including Unai Emerys, Villa were not all that close to perfect in many ways against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, not that theres anything bad about a clean-sheet win in the Premier League. But the comments from Villa fans a little further down this page tell the real story.||Supporters who have seen their team begin to perform consistently well for the first time since promotion to the Premier League four years ago are now much more inclined to show patience to their team  a gift as precious as gemstones in modern football.||"In Unai I trust," wrote one fan on this page on Monday. That trust meant there was rather less tension around Villa Park when the team were struggling to create much against Forest, and had lost Leon Bailey to injury. For his replacement Bertrand Traore to then score the opening goal  the second time in a week hed scored after being brought off the bench by Emery  will only have added to the general faith in the manager to make the right calls at the right moment.||Villas match against Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime  along with Arsenal, the two most improved sides in the Premier League this season  really does look like an occasion to savour. If Villa falter, expect the home fans to be a great deal more understanding than they have been in many years.  Win, however, and theyll feel unstoppable.||Small wonder that the great and the good want to go and watch them at the moment, up to and including our next two kings, who looked like they enjoyed themselves on Saturday.

No team faces a more consistently tougher set of final fixtures.||So, is finishing in the European places actually realistic?||Well, the good news is Villa have great momentum, since Emery took over, only the top two have better records. Then, of course, Villa get to play all their rivals, so its very much in their hands.||Some teams have started to nosedive: Chelsea (eight points adrift of Villa), Fulham (lost last four), Brentford (one win in six).

After several seasons Villa have a top quality manager and a squad good enough to stay clear of the relegation battle. With a few sensible additions Villa will certainly improve on this season. Personally I hope we don't get European football next season, it will give Emery a chance to build his own squad without the distraction.||James: Were watching a team totally transformed under Emery! Traore looks reinvigorated and bursting with confidence going forward. In terms of the game, a bit of a slow start, but these were the types of games that previously we were struggling to take control of. That being said, we kept our composure and took our chances when they came. Come on Villa!||Lee: I've not been so trusting in a manager since the Martin O'Neill era. Unai Emery has got such an amazing decision-making record and always seems to make the right choice to see out a result. In Unai I trust.||Graham: What is it they say about winning when playing badly? Since Villa have been in the Prem, if we've had an off day - which we've had many - we got battered. Nothing clicked against Forest, but with Emery in charge and a system on the field the players trust and believe in, a win was ground out.||Nottingham Forest fans||David: Forest are doomed - the run in is too tough, playing almost all the teams at the top of the table. Stick with Cooper though; he has created a cohesive squad of players who are actually on Forests books. If the bounce back doesnt go to plan, change manager soon enough to make a difference. If we do a Burnley the same applies the following season.||Derek: Couldnt agree more with our manager, certainly not outplayed but shot ourselves in the foot gifting another opponent a goal which totally changed the game. When will our defence learn to clear their lines and regroup?||Peter: Oh dear, its the same old from Forest. We give away another ridiculous goal and once we go behind there is no way back. We have no fight, no plan and currently no chance of staying up.||Steve: Again, I repeat, Cooper is out of his depth. He should have gone after the 4-0 defeat at West Ham.||Still yet to catch up on all the action from Saturday's Premier League fixtures?||Watch Match of the Day on BBC iPlayer now||And, if you missed Sunday's Match of the Day 2, you can find it here.||Brazil midfielder Philippe Coutinho, 30, is exploring options for an Aston Villa exit, with a return to Inter Milan possible.

We didn't want to let them transition, we didn't want to give them a lot of corners, and then we had three or four chances and scored two goals.||"I'm very happy for the fans but as well we have to be balanced."||On how Ollie Watkins is performing: "Ollie is working very well and his commitment with the team is very important. When he's scoring we're very happy for him. He's helping with his quality. Everybody is supporting him, trying to assist him, like today how Jacob Ramsey decided to assist him. We are very happy for everybody, Ollie is scoring and for him, [it's] very good."||On Aston Villa's aims for the season: "Those three points can help us to be in our target, which first is really the top 10. Then there's the more options to be a candidate to play for Europe. Getting points like today then we can be. Playing with big teams like next week against Newcastle, if we want to get it we have to improve more than what we are [currently] doing.

I have done it before for a season and a half and I loved pretty much every minute and Im happy to be back.||"I have performed at Stamford Bridge in one way or another for a long time over the years, so my overriding feeling absolutely is the focus on the job and trying to get wins.||"Ill appreciate being back but Ill have my serious face on."||Alex Howell, BBC Sport ||Frank Lampard has been speaking to the media before Chelsea's Premier League game against Brighton on Saturday.||Here are the key lines from his news conference||Kalidou Koulibaly's injury will keep him out for "a matter of weeks rather than days" which is "adisappointment for him and us but an opportunity too."||On Chelsea's lack of goals, Lampard said: "Trying to address it is our job.

"And it won't change against top-class opposition.||"It must be really difficult for him to know what to say after that.

Their manager Marco Silva will have a bit of a point to prove at Goodison Park after the way things went for him during his time there, but whether his players will turn up is another matter.||This is such a big game for Everton, though. I feel like they have to win it if they are going to stay up.||I thought the Toffees' performance in their defeat by Manchester United last time out was pretty weak but home is where it has to happen for Sean Dyche's side and I think things will go their way this weekend.||Jack's prediction: Everton need a win but they won't get it. 1-1.||Find out what Chris and Jack predicted for the rest of the weekend's games and cast your vote||Briony Bragg, This Fan Girl, external||I can promise you, of any other name in this list from any other club, who you would not want to be up against in a fight.||That would be Duncan Ferguson, or 'Big Dunc' as he is affectionally known. ||A powerhouse of a man, he was every defender's worst nightmare. Not only scaring the opposition, but a few referees in his time.||It's comical to think of today's major stars up against him. I don't think they would make it on to the pitch because of pure fear. He represents an era of football many miss so much. He's a hero wherever he goes for the respect he commands, and ironically one of the most kind-hearted people in world football today.||Read the full piece here||Tell us your selection for Everton's toughest player||Sean Dyche says Dominic Calvert-Lewin is well equipped to deal with the pressure of leading Everton's line because he is "a big player".||Asked whether there was too much expectation on the striker to get the goals needed to keep the Toffees in the Premier League, Dyche simply said that was "part of football".||"There's no extra pressure from me - that's just football," he said. "If you want to be a big player, you have got to take what comes your way.||"Dominic is a big player. He's played for England, scored goals at the top level and everyone should want that.||"You find a way of dealing with it as an individual, along with guidance from the staff and from your team-mates too."||Dyche would not confirm if Calvert-Lewin would be available to start against Fulham on Saturday but added he was "training well".||The Everton boss also suggested that others in his squad faced pressure and were handling it. ||"It's not just Dominic," he said. "We've got lots of big players here, and think about all those who don't have his record and are trying to forge their way through.||"It's all part of football."||Shamoon Hafez, BBC Sport||Sean Dyche has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Fulham.||Here are the key lines from the Everton manager:||The Toffees have suffered an injury blow as captain Seamus Coleman has been ruled out of the game through a hamstring injury, but Dyche is confident the right-back will will not be "out for too long".||On Fulham's performances since returning to the Premier League under Marco Silva, he said: "He is doing a very good job. Came out of the Championship comfortably and had a fantastic start. They had an awkward spell and it can happen to anyone."||On the loss against Manchester United: "They were better than us in the first half, second half we calmed it down a bit. We hung in there and some of the habits were good. If you come off slightly in the Premier League, you get found out."||Dyche was asked about reports that goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has a verbal agreement to leave if the club are relegated and simply replied: "No".||Everton have four games remaining at home and Dyche said: "We want it to be important and build that fortress. The team have responded at home and given the fans something to cheer about. The players have to use their energy and give their energy to the fans."||Dele Alli has suffered an injury which will keep him out for a "number of weeks" and Dyche added: "Some of the stuff reported, he is 26, they know what they should and shouldnt be doing. As a manager you cannot control everything in their lives. Should we be following them all day? You can only guide them and players have choices, we recommend they make good choices."||Striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin continues to train "well" but Dyche gave no indication whether he will return to the squad on Saturday. Asked if there is pressure on him when he does return, the manager said: "No pressure from me. That is football. If you want to be a big player, you have to take what comes your way. Everyone should want that. Pressure comes for a reason, it means you are a top player."||After Manchester Citys Erling Haaland set yet another goalscoring record on Tuesday, we asked you to tell us about the greatest forward you have ever seen play.||Here are some of your selections:||Dermot Kiernan, Glasgow: For me Bob Latchford was the perfect number nine, his buccaneering style was suited to that era in the '70s and early '80s. For a big guy he was astonishingly quick over the first few yards - his goalscoring was made up of fantastic headers and an anticipation of the right pass coming his way. The complete striker for Birmingham, Everton, Swansea and England.||John H, East London: Wayne Rooney banging in goals for Everton at the Gwladys Street End at Goodison Park. Best young player in the world at the time by a mile!||Read more of your suggestions here||Mike Hughes, BBC Radio Merseyside||Evertons fixture with Fulham on Saturday is of huge significance in the Blues ongoing battle to avoid relegation after their four-game unbeaten run came to an abrupt halt with the 2-0 defeat at Manchester United last Saturday.||The defensive organisation and solidity fashioned by Sean Dyche since his appointment went missing during the first half at Old Trafford. Everton tightened up in the second, but Uniteds superiority was obvious.||The players are unlikely to have needed much of a reminder that they fell back into some of their bad old ways, so by Monday morning at the latest, Dyche will have had the players working on correcting those faults. Defensive diligence must return to maximise Evertons chance of survival.||Meanwhile, Fulhams excellent form has deserted them recently after whats been a really good season back in the top flight. Aleksandar Mitrovics extended ban could hardly have come at a worse time and a touchline ban for Marco Silva doesnt help either.||But it would be foolish to assume their recent dip in form points towards a more serious decline. They have enough about them to cause problems for even the better teams. Joao Palhinha has been one of their standout performers and his midfield alliance with Andreas Pereira has brough strength, energy end creativity. Speedy right-back Antonee Robinson, who started his career at Everton, is one of the most underrated defenders in the Premier League.||If Everton can regain their resilience, then they have the wherewithal to come up with another vital victory. Their lack of a central striker as an attacking focus has been costly but theyve begun to get goals from around the team and that might well need to be the case for the remainder of the season.||A packed house at Goodison is guaranteed and, with some difficult games on the horizon, a win against Fulham could prove priceless.||Everton have only lost two of their past 14 league games against Fulham, although they did lose their last home game against the Cottagers in February 2021.||Fulham have lost each of their past four Premier League games, this after having only lost four of their previous 16 beforehand (W8 D4). The Cottagers last endured a longer losing run in a single top-flight season in April 2019 (run of nine).||Marco Silva is looking for his first Premier League win over Everton, a club where he managed 53 Premier League games. Hes only the third former Toffees manager to take charge of a Premier League game against them at Goodison Park after managing them in the competition, after Joe Royle (L1) and David Moyes (W2 L4).||Northern Ireland midfielder Isaac Price, 19, is close to signing a pre-contract agreement at Standard Liege after turning down a new deal at Everton.

But we were still in it across the second half and before they scored, I felt like we had a chance to nick a goal and see where the game goes.||"The overall performance wasnt great, but sometimes with a goalkeeper like Jordan Pickford you can stick in there.||"Unfortunately, that wasnt the case in the end on Saturday. He is an outstanding goalkeeper, though. You saw that Saturday."||Mike Richards,Unholy Trinity, external||If ever a players importance to a system was highlighted, look no further than last Saturday at Old Trafford.||Abdoulaye Doucoure has resurrected his Everton career since Sean Dyche joined the club. Often the forgotten man under Frank Lampard, hes become a pivotal figure as the more advanced of the midfield three.||His goal contributions have been a key factor in Evertons upturn in form, so it was no surprise we looked devoid of understanding in relation to certain players roles on Saturday.||With Demarai Gray playing behind Ellis Simms, the same intensity and execution of our press was severely reduced. Those behind our front two were then being pulled out of position, which made for an easy afternoon for Manchester United.||This has posed a huge dilemma for the manager, given Doucoure is only one game into a three match suspension.||With Dominic Calvert-Lewin edging ever closer to a return and calls for James Garner to get a long-awaited start since his return from injury, further options to plugging the Doucoure-shaped hole are available.||Whatever the manager decides to do, Everton cant afford to have a repeat of Saturdays performance if we are to pick up much needed points against Fulham and Crystal Palace.||We asked for your views on Saturday's Premier League game between Manchester United and Everton.||Here are some of your comments:||Man United fans||Christy: A very dynamic and professional performance from Man United. Annoyingly profligate though. Many players producing solid 7/10 performances. Rashford's injury is a concern. United gathering momentum again.||Tony: Completely one-sided game but United guilty yet again of not killing the match by half-time. We should have been so far out of reach, but Pickford played a blinder to keep the score down.||Alfie: I thought it was a good match and good win but I feel the team rely too much on Rashford. He is an amazing player but we have some real quality in this squad. It was great to see Martial back and fit and if he can stay fit until the end of the season he could be a real key player. It will also be good to have Casemiro back.||Jim: I am still worried that despite a million shots at goal they've only managed two goals. Been the same all season. Why they can't covert more shots to goals I don't know but hope that improves to make these sorts of games a canter to save tired legs!||Everton fans||Viresh: We played like Lampard's Everton. We had 15 shots, only 1 hits the target. Too many mistakes. Not much Possession. If we keep playing like this then there is a full chance we will get relegated. We can't afford to slip up in our next game against Fulham.||Will: We played a lot better than United until we conceded the first goal. After that first goal we completely fell apart. I think switching out Gana for Doucoure would've made a difference.||Andy: I am so tired of us being rubbish year after year. We can't rely on three other teams to be worse than us each season. Something has to change but I don't know what. A lot of players need to take a good look at themselves including DCL who has been a massive let down regardless of injury.||Still yet to catch up on all the action from Saturday's Premier League fixtures?||Watch Match of the Day on BBC iPlayer now||And, if you missed Sunday's Match of the Day 2, you can find it here.||Everton have yet to make a decision on the long-term future of 30-year-old England centre-back Conor Coady, who is on loan from Wolves.

Bert Trautmann.||Goalkeeper Trautmann played for City between 1949 and 1964 and is an all-time great figure at the club. A former member of the German army, his arrival at the club was met with some apprehension, but he more than earned his reputation as one of the greatest ever City players.||Obviously he was part of the club a good bit before my time, but his heroics are very much taught to you as a City fan from an early age, particularly his performance in the 1956 FA Cup Final.||Trautmann goes down as City's toughest player purely based on the fact he broke his neck during that final against Birmingham City and still carried on to make crucial saves in order for City to lift the trophy. Thats an incredible showing of perseverance in itself but when you think of that type of injury in our modern game it's almost inconceivable. ||There are many names who could have potentially made a list like this, but only one man played through a broken neck to win a major trophy for the club and that man is Bert Trautmann.||Read the full piece here||Tell us your selection for City's toughest player||Following the Champions League quarter-final first leg results, Manchester City have taken a big lead in Opta's predictions for the winner of the tournament.||The supercomputer calculates a team's percentage chance of lifting the trophy and, following their 3-0 demolition of Bayern Munich on Tuesday, City currently sit top with a 45.4% chance.||It is a less encouraging picture for Chelsea following their 2-0 away defeat by Real Madrid on Wednesday, with that result leaving them second from bottom with a 0.8% chance of winning the trophy for a third time.||The Opta supercomputer also predicts the chances of progression to the semi-finals and gives City a 96.1% chance to meet Real Madrid or Chelsea in the next round.||Chelsea, however, have a less hopeful 10.5% chance of meeting either City or Bayern Munich for a place in the final.||After Manchester Citys Erling Haaland set yet another goalscoring record on Tuesday, we asked you to tell us about the greatest forward you have ever seen play.||Here are some of your selections:||Neil Allcock, Peak District: Francis Lee - too many moments to mention but watched him play for Manchester City many, many times and saw him help us win the First Division, FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup.

Read Wednesday's full gossip column||Phil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football writer||Erling Haaland's relentless goalscoring rampage in his first season at Manchester City has written a new chapter in the Premier League's history books.||Haaland is now the highest scorer across all competitions in a single campaign since it began, eclipsing the 44 goals scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy at Manchester United and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.||The 22-year-old's past deeds at RB Salzburg and Borussia Dortmund created a frenzy of expectation when he signed for City, but the rate at which Haaland has racked up goals has surprised even the most optimistic observers.||In covering every Premier League season since its inception, I do not recall a striker with a more voracious appetite for goals playing in a team so ideally placed to satisfy it.||Haaland, from a defensive perspective, is a terrifying cocktail of physical power, lightning pace and a desire to score and score again. And again.||And the worrying thing for those hoping the well will run dry is that it is not a stretch to suggest Haaland and City are still getting used to each other, still perfecting the marriage of manager Pep Guardiola's passing game with the sheer power and menace the Norwegian offers.||This will not be the last record Haaland breaks.||Steven McInerney, who hosts the Esteemed Kompany YouTube channel, says he is "living the dream" watching Erling Haaland play for Manchester City and believes his presence could be the difference for City as they chase a first Champions League trophy.||Norway striker Haaland scored his 45th goal of the season in Tuesday's 3-0 win over Bayern Munich, which put City on the brink of the semi-finals.||McInerney told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast: "He's not normal, is he?||"He does give us that edge. When you've got a defence that stubborn and reliable, and you merge that with a goalscorer of his pedigree, it's quite a terrifying prospect.||"Haaland gives belief that maybe we didn't have in other years because he has that killer attitude. People like him are born to win trophies like the Champions League.||"There's always a chance when you've got him because he's that special. The scary thing is he's only 22, he's a City fan as well and I'm living the dream right now watching him play."||Listen to more reaction to City's win in the full programme on BBC Sounds||Former England striker Dion Dublin praised an "outstanding" display from Manchester City against Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-final first leg and believes Pep Guardiola's side have virtually secured their passage to the last four.||Dublin was impressed by how City dominated against the Bundesliga champions, and told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast he could not envisage them relinquishing their three-goal lead.||"City only have one way to play, on the front foot, wanting to squeeze high and then beat the press," said Dublin. "I am really not sure how Bayern will deal with it. ||"[The second leg] will be a different game in a different atmosphere in front of a full house in Germany.||"But, with the quality and set-up City have, I cannot see Pep allowing his players to drop their guard. No chance."||His views were backed by German journalist Mario Krischel, who cast doubt on any Bayern chance of overturning the deficit.||"I'd say the chance of Bayern qualifying for the semi-final is less than 1%," he said. "You always said 'this is Bayern and they can always win and turn a tie around.||"You don't get the feeling with this group."||Listen to full analysis on BBC Sounds||Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha believes John Stones' evolution into a midfielder under Pep Guardiola is testament to what a "fantastic player" he is.||Stones shone in City's 3-0 win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday after excelling in a midfield role from right-back at Southampton last weekend.||"We have seen him play in midfield in the past and it felt almost like a gimmick," Onuoha told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. "However, given the way City are playing now, it makes perfect sense.||"He is such a good footballer that he can go in there and dictate the pace of the game but also be a key defender in transition.||"It is great to see him fit, playing well and getting the accolades he deserves."||Onuoha also praised Guardiola's offensive approach in cementing the victory.||"You saw when Kevin de Bruyne was replaced, Guardiola brought on a striker," he said. "His way of being defensive is to be attacking and that level of aggression made a big difference."||Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's 3-0 win against Bayern Munich: "Emotionally I'm destroyed. I have aged 10 more years today. It was so demanding a game.||"In parts of the game they were better than us. It was difficult to control them. "In the last minutes of the (halves) we were better and we scored three fantastic chances."||"Now I have to relax - a day off for the guys and prepare for Leicester (in the Premier League on Saturday)."||On the challenge that still faces City: "It was an incredible result but I know a little bit what can happen in Munich.||"If you don't perform really well they are able to score one, two, three. I know that, the players know that.||"We have to do our game with huge, huge personality. If we don't do our game, anything can happen. To knock out these teams you have to have two good games, not just one."||On Erling Haaland's latest record: He's always a threat. In the first half (he was) not in the game but in the second half we started to play better and he was part of it.||"He showed he has the quality to assist as well. He is not just a top scorer."|| 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
